Witty, beautiful, and Irish-born Maeve Brennan was lured to such a position in 1948 and proceeded to dazzle everyone who met her, both in person and on the page. From 1954 to 1981 under the pseudonym The Long-Winded Lady,&#x201d; Brennan wrote matchless urban sketches of life in Times Square and the Village for the Talk of the Town&#x201d; column, and under her own name published fierce, intimate fictiontales of childhood, marriage, exile, longing, and the unforgiving side of the Irish temper. Yet even with her elegance and brilliance, Brennan&#x2019;s rise to genius was as extreme as her collapse: at the time of her death in 1993, Maeve Brennan had not published a word since the 1970s and had slowly slipped into madness, ending up homeless on the same streets of Manhattan that had built her career.<br><br>It is Angela Bourke&#x2019;s achievement with <i>Maeve Brennan: Homesick at The New Yorker</i> to bring much-deserved attention to Brennan&#x2019;s complex legacy in all her triumph and tragedyfrom Dublin childhood to Manhattan glamour, and from extraordinary literary achievement to tragic destitution. With this definitive biography of this troubled genius, it is clear that Brennan, though always an outsider in her own life and times, is rightfully recognized as one of the best writers to ever grace the pages of<i>The New Yorker</i>.<br></p><p>Angela Bourke is the author of <i>The Burning of Bridget Cleary</i>, winner of the Irish Times Nonfiction Prize. A native of Dublin, she once lived on Cherryfield Avenue, the street that Maeve Brennan made famous in her stories. She is Senior Lecturer in Modern Irish at University College, Dublin, and has been a visiting professor at Harvard, Boston College, and the University of Minnesota. She lives in Dublin.Bourke (<i>The Burning of Bridget Cleary</i>) writes a sensitive biography of writer Brennan, who came to the U.S. from Ireland as a teenager (her father was the first Irish ambassador to the U.S.) and in 1949, in her early 30s, joined the <i>New Yorker </i>to write about women's fashion. Tiny, fiercely intelligent and impeccably groomed, Brennan was cherished by her colleagues. William Maxwell, a close friend, edited her stories&#x2014;mainly fictionalized accounts of her Irish childhood, which he greatly admired&#x2014;for the magazine. She also wrote a "Talk of the Town" column under the pseudonym "The Long-Winded Lady." Yet behind the archly sophisticated persona, Bourke writes, was a fragile, alienated woman who, following a failed marriage to fellow writer St. Clair McKelway, drifted into an eccentric middle age and serious mental breakdown before leaving the <i>New Yorker.</i> She died in an obscure nursing home in 1993. Bourke, who teaches at University College, Dublin, draws a portrait rich in <i>New Yorker </i>history and modern Irish feminist history alike, one likely to do much to foster a new readership for Brennan's work. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Breen introduces us to a George Washington we rarely meet. During his first term as president, he decided that the only way to fulfill the Revolution was to take the new federal government directly to the people. He organized an extraordinary journey carrying him to all thirteen states. It transformed American political culture.<br> <br>For Washington, the stakes were high. If the nation fragmented, as it had almost done after the war, it could never become the strong, independent nation for which he had fought. In scores of communities, he communicated a powerful and enduring message&#x2014;that America was now a nation, not a loose collection of states. And the people responded to his invitation in ways that he could never have predicted.</p><p>T.H. Breen is currently the James Marsh Professor at-large at the University of Vermont. He is the author of eleven books on U.S. History, many of them prizewinners.George Washington&#x2019;s Journey CHAPTER I<p></p> <br><br> The Power of Public Opinion<p></p> <br>George Washington&#x2019;s departure for New England in 1789 introduces the people who accompanied him on his tours. The cast of characters included secretaries who attended to the details of travel and slaves who cared for the horses and wagons. The little cavalcade figured significantly in the creation of a new republican culture. Several months before setting out for New England, Washington had discovered firsthand the importance of public opinion, a powerful new force in the nation&#x2019;s political life. As he traveled to his first inauguration, he witnessed crowds of noisy, self-confident, and demanding Americans, women as well as men, many of them unable to vote, who lined the country roads and city streets. It was a profoundly moving experience for Washington. He was the product of an earlier colonial society in which the ordinary people had not enjoyed a significant role in politics. The Revolution changed all that. Washington quickly accommodated to this new, challenging political environment. He learned that by pleasing the people, he could communicate to them his own expansive vision for the country&#x2019;s future.<br> &#x2014; I &#x2014;<p></p> <br>George Washington&#x2019;s ambitious tour of the Eastern States, as people then called New England, began with little fanfare. The prospect of rain on the morning of October 15, 1789, would have discouraged many travelers just setting out on a long journey. Washington was not such a person. The overcast skies eventually produced showers, which began falling about ten o&#x2019;clock, but the weather failed to diminish the president&#x2019;s high spirits. He had been eagerly contemplating his departure from New York City, then the capital of the United States, for several months, and now that he had finally commenced his trip, his major concern was maintaining a tight schedule.1<br> <br>The little procession followed the Post Road northeast toward the Connecticut line. No surviving record suggests that adoring citizens endured the rain to cheer their president, the result no doubt of the lack of public announcement that Washington was taking a significant trip. No soldiers were present, no special guards. No one mentioned that the travelers carried arms. Washington had no reason to fear the American people. He sat in an open carriage, not exactly an ideal situation for a rainy autumn day, but he did not complain. More than a year later, when he organized a much more arduous trip to the southern states, Washington insisted on traveling in a stunning new coach, rumored to be one of the most elegant vehicles in the nation, but for the present, he made do with an older carriage that he had owned since the end of the war. Four well-groomed bays pulled the vehicle.<br> <br>Washington took exceptional pride in the appearance of his horses. He had a well-deserved reputation as a skilled rider. Before the Revolution, he had competed with Colonel William Byrd, a wealthy Virginia planter, for the honor of having the most impressive equipage in the colony. Contemporaries described the contest as a rivalry of &#x201c;the grays against the bays.&#x201d; After he became president, Washington continued to monitor the condition of his animals, perhaps a little obsessively. In New York City, people referred to them specifically as the &#x201c;muslin horses.&#x201d; Every morning at dawn, stable boys carefully brushed the horses, and when they had finished, a supervisor ran a clean muslin cloth over each horse looking for &#x201c;the slightest stain.&#x201d; There was hell to pay if he found an imperfection. One of the stable boys went by the name of Paris. Washington had recently brought this young slave to the capital from Virginia. He is of special interest for us, because Paris and a fellow slave, Giles, assisted the president on the major trips, first to New Hampshire and later to the southern states.<br> <br>Washington&#x2019;s favorite chargers, one of which accompanied him on the New England tour, received even more elaborate attention before public events. These were large horses of the kind that Washington had ridden during the Revolution, and many paintings from the period show the general standing next to a great white charger. According to Washington&#x2019;s grandson, then a small child, in the evening the president ordered the show horses &#x201c;covered entirely over with a paste, of which whiting was the principal component part.&#x201d; The animals spent the night in this condition. It was reported that by &#x201c;morning the composition had become hard, was well-rubbed in, and curried and brushed, which process gave to the coats a beautiful, flossy, and satin-like appearance.&#x201d; Stable hands addressed the smallest details. Hooves were blackened, teeth &#x201c;picked and cleaned.&#x201d; Only then, as valued props in political theater, were the white chargers led out for service.2<br> <br>The New England procession also included a baggage wagon driven by one of the six servants who traveled with Washington. The word servant was a euphemism. These men were actually slaves who had worked for the president at Mount Vernon. For this occasion, they wore special garments selected to impress the public. The coachmen and postilions, for example, sported blanket cloaks, new jockey caps, and fashionable boots. Like the horses, the slaves were part of the show. Their appearance reflected the taste and judgment of the president.<br> <br>Behind the wagon, a slave, probably Paris, led a large charger, which Washington intended to ride as he entered communities along the way. A tall figure mounted on a spirited horse, of course, made a more powerful impression on the spectators than did a man waving from an aging carriage. At the start of the tour, Washington wore a business suit appropriate for a person of his social standing, but at some moment along the road, he elected to exchange it for a full uniform of the Continental Army. He discovered that although he described himself simply as a citizen of the new republic, the American people still regarded him as General Washington, the hero who won independence on the battlefield. And in the political theater of the new republic, what the people wanted or expected powerfully shaped the president&#x2019;s performance.<br> <br>Riding alongside the carriage, at least for the first few miles, were several members of Washington&#x2019;s cabinet. Whether John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and Henry Knox&#x2014;chief justice, secretary of the treasury, and secretary of war, respectively&#x2014;wanted to be out in the rain is impossible to document. They probably chatted among themselves. No doubt, they regarded a proper send-off for the president as part of their official duties.<br> <br>Before setting out for New England, Washington had solicited advice from these men. He valued their opinions, and since the tour was an unprecedented undertaking, he wanted to know specifically whether they thought it wise for the president to be absent from the nation&#x2019;s capital for several weeks. If Congress still had been in session, he would never have proposed the trip. He took a keen interest in legislative debates. Now, however, during the recess, and with official business less pressing than usual, Washington wanted assurance from the cabinet that he was doing the right thing.<br> <br>The response from these men was encouraging. James Madison could not be present for the departure, but the newly elected congressman from Virginia who had worked so closely with Washington during the Constitutional Convention informed Washington that he &#x201c;saw no impropriety in my proposed trip to the Eastward.&#x201d;3 Knox also gave a positive answer, as did Jay, who with astute political insight into the deep sectional differences dividing the nation warned Washington that &#x201c;a similar visit would be expected by those of the Southern [states].&#x201d;4 Hamilton gave the issue careful thought. &#x201c;Had conversation with Colonel Hamilton on the propriety of my making a tour through the Eastern states during the recess of Congress to acquire knowledge of the facts of the Country,&#x201d; Washington noted in his diary. Hamilton concluded that he &#x201c;thought it a very desirable plan and advised accordingly.&#x201d;5<br> <br>An empty seat in the carriage begged explanation. John Adams, the vice president, decided not to travel with Washington on the Eastern States tour. If he had been savvier politically, he would have done so. The trip to Boston would have provided him with a much-needed opportunity to be seen publicly in the company of the most popular man in America. More important, the long hours traveling in the carriage might have sparked frank conversation between them that could have eased tensions that troubled their relationship.<br> <br>Even before the first election under the Constitution took place, some of Washington&#x2019;s most enthusiastic supporters raised awkward questions about Adams&#x2019;s character. In 1788, for example, in a confidential letter to Thomas Jefferson, who was then in France, Madison explained that he regarded Adams as a potential political liability for the new administration. He hoped that the Electoral College would turn to someone with more promising credentials. &#x201c;J. Adams has made himself obnoxious to many particularly in the Southern States,&#x201d; Madison wrote. There was more. Rumors circulated that Adams had questioned Washington&#x2019;s leadership during the Revolution. According to Madison, &#x201c;Others recollecting his [Adams&#x2019;s] cabal during the war against general Washington, knowing his extravagant self-importance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. conclude that he would not be a very cordial second to the General, and that an impatient ambition might even intrigue for a premature advancement.&#x201d;6<br> <br>Although Adams did in fact win the vice presidency, he remained insensitive to political nuance. On such matters, his wife, Abigail, showed much more insight. She could hardly believe that Adams had declined the opportunity to accompany Washington. Writing from New York to a relative in Massachusetts, she observed tersely that the president &#x201c;would have had Mr. Adams accept a seat in his coach, but he excused himself from motives of delicacy.&#x201d;7 What counted for delicacy in this situation, she did not make clear. Adams may have been brooding over stories that he and Washington were on bad terms. It is true that unflattering tales were circulating in New England. One man in Boston demanded to know from John Quincy Adams, the vice president&#x2019;s son, &#x201c;the truth of a Report which had been industriously spread here within this week past &#x2018;that there is so great a Coolness between the P&#x2014;&#x2014;t &amp; V-P&#x2014;&#x2014;t that they do not speak to each other.&#x2019; &#x201d;8 Although the two men in fact spoke regularly, Adams could never ignore a slight, real or imagined, and he probably reasoned that by traveling alone, he was acting on some high-minded principle.<br> <br>Adams left New York for Boston a few days ahead of the president. Still trying to help her husband, Abigail told him on October 20, &#x201c;I presume the President will overtake you on the Road [since] he set off on Thursday.&#x201d; You will remember, she added, what had happened in New York &#x201c;the Saturday Evening when you took leave of him. On Sunday he [Washington] expressed himself anxious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lest he had not been sufficiently urgent with you to accompany him.&#x201d; Abigail counseled Adams not to let personal feelings impair his judgment. She was sure that Washington will &#x201c;send you an invitation to accompany him [from Boston] to Portsmouth, which I hope you will find&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. convenient to accept.&#x201d;9 For his part, Washington was probably relieved that he did not have to endure long hours in a coach with Adams.<br> <br>Two other men who figure centrally in our story traveled to the eastward with Washington. Today we might describe Tobias Lear and William Jackson as special assistants to the president, but at the time they were generally known as secretaries. To be sure, Washington referred to these young bachelors who lived in his house&#x2014;in New York, they occupied a cramped dormitory room on the top floor&#x2014;as &#x201c;family&#x201d; or as &#x201c;Gentlemen of the household.&#x201d;10 Although Washington intended the designation &#x201c;Gentlemen of the household&#x201d; as a compliment, he may soon have had second thoughts about the political connotations of such a phrase. In a republic it smacked of monarchical culture, of a world of court lackeys and sycophantic placemen. However happy these men may have been working so closely with Washington&#x2014;it was an honor to be asked to serve&#x2014;the job was extremely demanding. They were on call all the time. Their duties included drafting routine letters for the president, carrying messages from him to members of Congress, and organizing routine household business.<br> <br>Tobias Lear, Washington&#x2019;s long-serving secretary, never witnessed the face of battle during the Revolution. Nevertheless, soon after graduation from Harvard College in 1783, he became Washington&#x2019;s most trusted assistant. He owed the appointment to glowing recommendations testifying to his intelligence and diligence. Lear soon moved from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where he had grown up, to Mount Vernon and quickly demonstrated an ability to organize household affairs not only for Washington, but also&#x2014;perhaps more important&#x2014;for Martha and her grandchildren. He had a good eye for numbers, and most of the personal records that have survived in his hand record the bills he paid to various merchants in Washington&#x2019;s name. Indeed, it is from his detailed accounts that we know that Washington purchased a stylish new cap for Paris the slave just before the New England trip.<br> <br>Lear possessed the perfect temperament for a personal assistant. He had a capacity to disappear into the background as family members and political leaders made decisions. In New York, he went about his business, always competent but never intrusive, showing initiative without seeming pushy, and studiously diffident in the presence of superiors. Although one might have expected the young man to strike out on his own, he remained tied to the Washington family for the better part of his life. Lear did try his luck with business ventures during the mid-1790s, but his experiment in land speculation and in managing a canal company ended in failure. He kept returning to his patron, and in 1799 he achieved a measure of celebrity as the man who recorded Washington&#x2019;s last words at the moment of his death.11 Like the other secretaries, Lear never told tales in public about what went on behind closed doors. On the morning of October 15, 1789, as the presidential party left New York City, his life still seemed full of promise. He was excited about returning to friends and family in New Hampshire.<br> <br>Of all the people who traveled to New England, William Jackson remains both the most intriguing and enigmatic. He accompanied Washington on every major trip during his first term as president. He was present at Boston and Charleston, Portsmouth and Savannah, Hartford and Richmond. Few other men ever experienced such sustained access to Washington. Day after day, over thousands of miles, sharing the discomforts of the road and trying to keep up polite conversation, these two men maintained a formal relationship that seems to have been defined more by mutual respect than deep affection.<br> <br>Despite years of service, Jackson never entered the inner circle of Washington&#x2019;s most trusted associates. It was not that the president questioned Jackson&#x2019;s abilities or feared indiscretion. Rather, Jackson remained an employee who carried out assigned responsibilities but was always careful not to overstep the social constraints of his position. If he had been a person of different character, Jackson might have produced a sensational book revealing aspects of Washington&#x2019;s life that remained hidden. But that did not happen.

He begins by chronicling the legacy of the 20th century with its technological progress and wars and argues that the United States should continue to play a central international role. He contends that world peace is inseparable from world power and that real peace is not absence of conflict but living with unending conflictthe natural state of world affairs. He is skeptical of Gorbachev whom he sees as being good at images but as seeking change that will permit the Soviet Union to find hegemony. Still, he cogently argues for a realistic policy toward the Soviets, involving a mix of deterrence, competition, and negotiation. Chapters on the awakening giant (China), the reluctant giant (Japan), and the Third World are insightful. Nixon believes that our system is popular today, and that we should take advantage of it. Highly recommended. Frank Kessler, Missouri Western State Coll., St. Joseph<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Nixon, who as U.S. president opened diplomatic relations with China, now recommends negotiations with the Soviet Union to forge commercial treaties and reduce the risk of accidental war. He strongly opposes the adoption of protectionist trade measures against Japan. These positions may surprise some readers, but on other issues his hard-line views are more predictable, if one scrutinizes the sweeping Cold War rhetoric carefully. On nuclear armaments, he endorses Reagan's plan for laser-based weapons in space ("Star Wars") and urges "no first-strike vulnerability." He advocates continued support of Nicaragua's contras, covert CIA actions overseas, build-up of nuclear power, more U.S. cruise missiles in Europe, the establishment of U.S. air bases in Saudi Arabia. He blames Africa's poverty on the terrible governments there. This hawkish blueprint of U.S. policy adds little of real substance to current debate.

An equally fascinating part of the project is the exploration of ways that traditional cultural expression can help revitalize contemporary culture, a goal exemplified by this volume, itself part of the Silk Road Project activities.<p>The greater Silk Road encompassed certain sea routes and the loose system of trails that crossed the mountains and deserts of Central Asia to connect East Asia and the Mediterranean. This historical network, at its height from the second century B.C.E. until the fourteenth century, was the most cosmopolitan area on earth. Merchants carrying fine silks and lacquers westward from China would mingle with traders bringing fragile Roman glass to the east or with Indians seeking markets for carved ivory cosmetic boxes and gold ornaments for fashionable women. It was by these routes, too, that the religions of Buddhism and Islam, among others, spread throughout Asia.</p><p>This richly illustrated, lively book is keynoted by Yo-Yo Ma's candid insights into contemporary music and the Silk Road. Distinguished contributors who explore the present-day Silk road and its absorbing history include a composer, an ethnomusicologist, an archaeologist, a photographer, a scientist, a film critic, and two art historians.</p><p><b>Elizabeth ten Grotenhuis</b> is associate professor of Asian/Japanese art history at Boston University and associate in research at the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard University.

K�stenberger's new commentary on the Gospel of John draws on extensive research and engages the best of contemporary scholarship, yet provides a readable study that will be beneficial to students, pastors, and scholars.<br><br>After considering the historical context of the letter as well as its relation to other New Testament writings, K�stenberger turns to his exegetical work. An introduction to each exegetical unit is provided along with the author's own translation of the Greek text. In the course of his verse-by-verse comments, K�stenberger incorporates references to other ancient writings that help explain the book's theological, cultural, and social context. Where appropriate, he draws upon the work of other commentators and provides extensive notes for further reading and research.</p><p>Andreas K�stenberger (Ph.D., Trinity Evangelical Divinity School) is professor of New Testament and director of Ph.D/Th.M. studies at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary.

Lost without his wife's love, Robicheaux's haunted soul mirrors the intensity and dusky mystery of New Orleans' French Quarter -- the place he calls home, and the place that nearly destroys him when he becomes involved in the case of a young prostitute whose body is found in a bayou. Thrust into the world of drug lords and arms smugglers, Robicheaux must face down a subterranean criminal world and come to terms with his own bruised heart in order to survive.</p></p><p><b>James Lee Burke,</b> a rare winner of two Edgar Awards, is the author of twenty-one novels, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Sunset Limited, Cimarron Rose, Cadillac Jukebox, Burning Angel, Dixie City Jam, Purple Cane Road, Bitterroot,</i> and <i>Jolie Blon's Bounce.</i> He lives with his wife in Missoula, Montana, and New Iberia, Louisiana.<p><b>Chapter One</b><br> </p><p> The evening sky was streaked with purple, the color of torn plums, and a light rain had started to fall when I came to the end of the blacktop road that cut through twenty miles of thick, almost impenetrable scrub oak and pine and stopped at the front gate of Angola penitentiary. The anti-capital-punishment crowd -- priests, nuns in lay clothes, kids from LSU with burning candles cupped in their hands -- were praying outside the fence. But another group was there too -- a strange combination of frat boys and rednecks -- drinking beer from Styrofoam coolers filled with cracked ice; they were singing "Glow, Little Glow Worm," and holding signs that read THIS BUD IS FOR YOU, MASSINA AND JOHNNY, START YOUR OWN SIZZLER FRANCHISE TODAY. </p><p> "I'm Lieutenant Dave Robicheaux, New Orleans police department," I said to one of the guards on the gate. I opened my badge for him. </p><p> "Oh yeah, Lieutenant. I got your name on my clipboard. I'll ride with you up to the Block," he said, and got in my car. His khaki sleeves were rolled over his sunburned arms, and he had the flat green eyes and heavy facial bones of north Louisiana hill people. He smelled faintly of dried sweat, Red Man, and talcum powder. "I don't know which bunch bothers me worse. Those religious people act like we're frying somebody for a traffic citation, and those boys with the signs must not be getting much pussy over at the university. You staying for the whole thing?" </p><p> "Nope." </p><p> "Did you nail this guy or something?" </p><p> "He was just a low-level button man I used to run in once in a while. I never got him on anything. In fact, I think he screwed up more jobs than he pulled off. Maybe he got into the mob through Affirmative Action." </p><p> The guard didn't laugh. He looked out the window at the huge, flat expanse of the prison farm, his eyes narrowing whenever we passed a trusty convict walking along the dirt road. The main living area of the prison, a series of two-story, maximum-security dormitories contained within a wire fence and connected by breezeways and exercise yards and collectively called the Block, was as brilliantly lit as cobalt in the rain, and in the distance I could see the surgically perfect fields of sugar cane and sweet potatoes, the crumbling ruins of the nineteenth-century camps silhouetted against the sun's red afterglow, the willows bent in the breeze along the Mississippi levee, under which many a murdered convict lay buried. </p><p> "They still keep the chair in the Red Hat House?" I said. </p><p> "You got it. That's where they knock the fire out their ass. You know how the place come by that name?" </p><p> "Yes," I said, but he wasn't listening. </p><p> "Back before they started putting the mean ones in lockdown in the Block, they worked them down by the river and made them wear striped jumpers and these red-painted straw hats. Then at night they stripped them down, body-searched them, then run them into the Red Hat House and threw their clothes in after them. There wasn't no screens on the windows, and them mosquitoes would make a Christian out of a man when a baseball bat couldn't." </p><p> I parked the car and we entered the Block, passed through the first lockdown area, where both the snitches and the dangerous ones stayed, walked down the long, brilliantly lit breezeway between the recreation yards into the next dormitory, passed through another set of hydraulic locks and a dead space where two hacks sat at a table playing cards and where a sign overhead read no guns beyond this point, into the rec and dining halls where the black trustees were running electric waxers on the gleaming floors, and finally walked up the spiral iron steps to a small maximum-security corner where Johnny Massina was spending the last three hours of his life. </p><p> The guard from the gate left me, and another one pulled the single lever that slid back the cell door. Johnny wore a white shirt, a pair of black slacks, and black Air Force shoes with white socks. His wiry gray and black hair was dripping with sweat, and his face was the color and texture of old paper. He looked up at me from where he was seated on his bunk, and his eyes were hot and bright and moisture was beaded across his upper lip. He held a Camel cigarette between his yellowed fingers, and the floor around his feet was covered with cigarette butts. </p><p> "Streak, I'm glad you come. I didn't know if you were going to make it," he said. </p><p> "How you doing, Johnny?" </p><p> His hands clutched his thighs and he looked at the floor, then back at me. I saw him swallow. </p><p> "How scared you ever been?" he said. </p><p> "In Vietnam I had some moments." </p><p> "That's right. You were over there, weren't you?" </p><p> "Way back in '64, before it got real hot." </p><p> "I bet you were a good soldier." </p><p> "I was just a live one, that's all." </p><p> I felt instantly stupid at my remark. He saw the regret in my face. </p><p> "Don't worry about it," he said. "I got a whole bunch of shit to tell you. Look, you remember when you took me to a couple of those AA meets, that step you guys take when you want to confess something, what'd you call it?" </p><p> "Step Five, admitting to yourself, God, and somebody else the exact nature of your faults." </p><p> "That's it. Well, I done it. To a colored preacher, yesterday morning. I told him every bad thing I ever done." </p><p> "That's good, Johnny." </p><p> "No, you listen. I told him the truth and I come clean with some really heavy shit, sexual things I always been ashamed of and I never understood. You know what I mean? I didn't keep nothing back. I also told him about the two guys I whacked in my life. I dumped one guy over the rail of a passenger liner on the way to Havana, and in 1958 I took out Bugsy Siegel's cousin with a shotgun. You know what it means to ice a relative of Bugsy Siegel? After I confessed it to the preacher, I told the guard and the assistant warden about it. You know these dumb cocksuckers couldn't care less? </p><p> "Wait a minute, let me finish. I told all this stuff because somebody's got to believe I didn't snuff that broad. I wouldn't throw no young girl out a hotel window, Streak. I got no kick coming about being fried. I figure it all comes out even in the end, but I want these bastards to know I only pushed the button on guys that played by the same rules I did. Can you relate to that?" </p><p> "I think so. I'm glad you did a fifth step, too, Johnny." </p><p> He smiled for the first time. His face glistened in the light. "Hey, tell me something. Is it true Jimmie the Gent is your brother?" </p><p> "You hear a lot of bullshit in the street." </p><p> "You both got that black Cajun hair with a white patch in it, like you got skunk blood in you." He laughed. His mind was now moving away from the ride he would take in three hours, manacled in a waist chain, to the Red Hat House. "Once he contracted us for some poker machines for his places. After we put them in we told him he gets all his machines from us -- cigarettes, Pac-Man, and rubbers. So he says no rubbers, he's got class clubs and he don't put rubber machines in them. So we tell him he don't have a choice, he either buys the whole line or he don't get linen service, the Teamsters put a picket up on his sidewalk, and the parish health office finds out his dishwashers got leprosy. So what's he do? He invites Didoni Giacano -- Didi Gee himself -- and his whole family for lasagna at his restaurant, and they arrive on Sunday afternoon like a bunch of <i>cafoni</i> that just got off the boat from Palermo, because Didi thinks Jimmie has got respectable connections and is going to get him into the Knights of Columbus or something. Didi Gee probably weighs three hundred pounds and he's covered with hair like an animal and he scares the crap out of everybody in downtown New Orleans, but his mama is this little dried-up Sicilian lady that looks like a mummy wrapped in black rags and she still hits Didi on the hands with a spoon when he reaches across the table and don't ask. </p><p> "So in the middle of dinner Jimmie starts telling Mama Giacano what a great guy Didi Gee is, how everybody down at the Chamber of Commerce and Better Business Bureau think he's a big plus for the city, and how Didi don't let anybody push his friends around. For example, he says, some scumbags tried to put some machines in Jimmie's restaurants that Jimmie, a Catholic man, don't want. Mama Giacano might look like she's made out of dried-up pasta, but her hot little black eyes tell everybody she knows what he's talking about. Then Jimmie says Didi tore them machines out, smashed them up with hammers, and run a truck up and down on them behind the restaurant. </p><p> "Didi Gee's got a mouthful of beer and raw oysters and almost chokes to death. He's spitting glop all over his plate, his kids are beating him on the back, and he coughs up an oyster that could plug a sewer main. Mama Giacano waits till his face ain't purple anymore, then tells him she didn't raise her son to eat like a herd of pigs and says he should go wash </p><p> out his mouth in the bathroom because everybody else at the table is getting sick looking at him, and when he don't get up right away she busts him across the knuckles with her spoon. Then Jimmie says he wants to take the whole family out on his sailboat and maybe Didi Gee ought to join the Yacht Club, too, because all these millionaires think he's a swell guy, and besides, Mama Giacano would really love the Italian-American celebrations they have on the Fourth of July and Columbus Day. And even if Didi don't join, which everybody knows he won't because he hates water and pukes his guts out just crossing the Mississippi ferry, Jimmie is going to drive out and get Mama Giacano whenever she wants and sail her all around Lake Pontchartrain." </p><p> He laughed again and ran his hand through his wet hair. He licked his lips and shook his head, and I saw the fear come back into his eyes. </p><p> "I bet he already told you that story, didn't he?" he said. </p><p> "They didn't give me too long, Johnny. Is there something else you wanted to tell me?" </p><p> "Yeah, there is. You always treated me decent and I thought maybe I could repay you a little bit." He wiped the sweat out of his eyes with the flat of his fingers. "I think maybe I got some heavy dues to pay on the other side, too. It don't hurt to try to square what you can now, does it?" </p><p> "You don't owe me." </p><p> "A guy with my track record owes the whole fucking earth. Anyway, here's the deal. Yesterday this punk by the name of L. J. Potts from Magazine Street is pushing a broom out in the corridor, clacking it against my bars and making all kinds of noise so I can't sleep. So I say I ain't working on the Good Housekeeping Award and would this punk take his broom somewhere else before I get my hands on it and shove it up his hole. So the punk, who's got a brother named Wesley Potts, tries to impress me. He asks if I know a New Orleans homicide roach named Robicheaux, and he's smirking, see, because he thinks you're one of the cops that nailed me. I tell him maybe, and he keeps smirking and says, well, here's some good news because his brother Wesley has it that this particular homicide roach has stuck his nose in the wrong place and if he don't stop it he's going to get whacked." </p><p> "He sounds like a gasbag, Johnny." </p><p> "Yeah, he probably is, except the difference with him and his brother is I think they're connected up with the greasers." </p><p> "The Colombians?" </p><p> "Fucking A. They're spreading around the country faster than AIDS. They'll take out anybody, too -- whole families, the children, the old people, it don't matter to them. You remember that bar on Basin that got torched? The greaser that did it stood in the doorway in broad daylight with a fucking flamethrower on his back and because he was in a good mood he gave everybody one minute to get out of the place before he melted it into a big pile of bubbling plastic. You watch out for those cocksuckers, Streak." </p><p> He lit a fresh Camel from the butt in his hand. He was sweating heavily now, and he wiped his face on his sleeve and smelled himself simultaneously. Then his face got gray and still and he stared straight ahead with his palms gripped on his thighs. </p><p> "You better leave now. I think I'm going to get sick again," he said. </p><p> "I think you're a stand-up guy, Johnny." </p><p> "Not on this one." </p><p> We shook hands. His hand was slick and light in mine.<br> </p><p> They electrocuted Johnny Massina at midnight. Back in my houseboat on Lake Pontchartrain, with the rain beating on the roof and dancing on the water outside, I remembered the lines I had heard sung once by a black inmate in Angola:<br> </p><p> <i>I ax my bossman, Bossman, tell me what's right.<br> He whupped my left, said, Boy, now you know what's right.<br> I wonder why they burn a man twelve o'clock hour at night.<br> The current much stronger; the peoples turn out all the light.</i><br> </p><p> My partner was Cletus Purcel. Our desks faced each other in a small room in the old converted fire station on Basin Street. Before the building was a fire station it had been a cotton warehouse, and before the Civil War slaves had been kept in the basement and led up the stairs into a dirt ring that served both as an auction arena and a cockfighting pit. </p><p> Cletus's face looked like it was made from boiled pigskin, except there were stitch scars across the bridge of his nose and through one eyebrow, where he'd been bashed by a pipe when he was a kid in the Irish Channel. He was a big man, with sandy hair and intelligent green eyes, and he fought to keep his weight down, unsuccessfully, by pumping iron four nights a week in his garage. </p><p> "Do you know a character named Wesley Potts?" I asked. </p><p> "Christ, yes. I went to school with him and his brothers. What a family. It was like having bread mold as your next-door neighbor." </p><p> "Johnny Massina said this guy's talking about pulling my plug." </p><p> "Sounds like bullshit to me. Potts is a gutless lowlife. He runs a dirty movie house on Bourbon. I'll introduce you to him this afternoon. You'll really enjoy this guy." </p><p> "I've got his file right here. Two narcotics, six obscenity busts, no convictions. Evidently one serious beef with the IRS." </p><p> "He fronts points for the greasers." </p><p> "That's what Massina said." </p><p> "All right, we'll go talk to him after lunch. You notice I say 'after lunch,' because this guy is your real genuine bucket of shit. By the way, the parish coroner in Cataouatche returned your call and said they didn't do an autopsy on that colored girl." </p><p> "What do you mean, they didn't do one?" I said. </p><p> "He said they didn't do one because the sheriff's office didn't request it. It went down as a drowning. What's all this about, anyway, Dave? Don't you have enough open cases without finding work down in Cataouatche Parish? Those people down there don't follow the same rules we do, anyway. You know that." </p><p> Two weeks before, I had been fishing in a pirogue on Bayou Lafourche, flycasting popping-bugs along the edge of the lily pads that grew out from the banks. The shore was thickly lined with cypress trees, and it was cool and quiet in the green-gold morning light that fell through the c...</p></p><h2>The Measure of a Man</h2><p>Newly revised and updated for a new generation of men, this classic shows men how to live according to God&#39;s direction-faithfully, lovingly, and spiritually-offering twenty biblical guidelines, with life applications and words of inspiration.</p><p>Since 1974, men around the world have practiced the biblical teaching in this book to live by God&#x2019;s terms.

Gillis is also known for inventing the "Gonzo" genre of pornography, played out in the film <i>Boogie Nights</i> by Burt Reynolds' character.</p><p><i>Pure Filth</i> appears as transcripts from the films Jamie produced during these early years of radical and highly personal pornography. Completed just before his death in February 2010, Gillis contributed an introduction to each transcript to shed light on his ideas and plans, as well as anecdotal details and personal commentary. The book has more to do with an artist's understanding of sex than the mere views of a flesh peddler. The careful language and brutal intelligence that Jamie brought to interviews are what separates the conversations from any other work that might have more academic or prurient pretensions.</p><p>Extreme novelist <b>Peter Sotos</b>, perhaps better known and appreciated in France and the United Kingdom than his home country, was a good friend of Jamie Gillis, and Sotos' unusual perspective makes this volume possible.</p><br></p><p>Peter Sotos became interested in Jamie Gillis&#x2019; private tapes&#x201d; after being told of their limited existence by an old troll in a porn shop that specialized in under-the-counter sales. Thinking that the films Jamie was releasing were far more intriguing than sex acts performed by low level prostitutes, Sotos started transcribing the conversations that took place between filmmaker and performer. It is his contention that the work is more about the insulting elasticity of respect than it is an obscene record of hookers pushed to their mental, rather than purely physical, limits.<br><br>Jamie Gillis is known as one of the first male superstars&#x201d; of pornography. He started his career in NY during the early basement years and lasted through the Times Square and LA glitz booms, eventually creating the gonzo ( reality porn&#x201d;) genre. He was one of the very few actors capable of introspectively writing about his career, tastes and experiences during his lifetime, and most of it pre-internet. In Pure Filth, Jamie explains that his interest in what sex really is came from his greater desire for exploration and exposure of the sexual imagination in all its variety&#x201d;. <br>"This is deadly serious stuff.

Now the brave ancestors we have hidden for so long stand again for all to see. With these words the Elders of Waitaha tell us that their ancient and sacred lore is shared for the first time. Bound in secrecy for centuries, protected through the ages by those who gave their lives to keep it safe, this knowledge travels out of the past to be revealed in Song of Waitaha . For years New Zealand archaeologists have been puzzled by a people who lived without weapons and created trading systems that moved industrial stone the length of the country. These writings explain they were a peaceful confederation of over two hundred iwi known as the Nation . It tells their story from the dawntime of exploration and settlement to the final days. Song of Waitaha repairs the torn fabric of our past and opens doors into the future. If we are not gentle with life, the garden within us dies. The Histories tell of a society where many peoples walked in harmony with each other. It shows how they honored the land and waters to sustain life harvesting birds and fish to increase the numbers, cutting tall trees for waka and leaving the forest stronger, carving stone without breaking its spirit, respecting the rivers keeping the environment in balance. This treasure from the days of the ancestors journeys out of timeless realms where the people and the land were one beneath the stars. It carries wisdom born of the ancient trails of the spirit and adds a thousand years of wonder to our past. It reminds us if we lose our story we lose our dream.</p><p></p><h2>Timberline Lodge: The History, Art, and Craft of an American Icon</h2><p>Timberline Lodge &#x2014; the magnificent Oregon icon on Mount Hood &#x2014; is one the few twentieth-century American buildings of its size constructed and furnished entirely by hand.

Tory had never believed in the curse, but everyone for miles around the tiny village of Harwood knew the legend of the beautiful dia-mond-and-pearl necklace. People whispered about it, feared it, coveted and revered the magnificent piece of jewelry crafted in the thirteenth century for the bride of Lord Fallon. It was said the necklace&#x2014;The Bride's Necklace&#x2014;could bring its owner untold happiness, or unbearable tragedy.<br><br>That hadn't kept Tory from stealing it. Or selling it to a moneylender in Dartfield for enough coin that she and Claire could finally escape.<br><br>But that had been nearly two months ago, before the two of them had reached London and the ridiculously small amount of money Tory had been forced to accept for the very valuable necklace had nearly run out.<br><br>In the beginning, she had been certain she could find a job as a governess for some nice, respectable family, but so far she had failed. The few clothes she and Claire had been able to take along the night they had fled were fashionable, but Tory's cuffs had begun to fray, and faint stains appeared on the hem of Claire's apricot muslin gown. Though their education and speech were that of the upper classes, Tory didn't have a single solitary reference, and without one, she had been turned away again and again.<br><br>She was becoming nearly as desperate as she had been before she left Harwood Hall.<br><br>"What are we going to do, Tory?" Her sister's voice cut through the self-pity rising like a dark tide inside her. "Mr. Jennings says if we can't pay our rent by the end of the week, he is going to throw us out."<br><br>Tory shuddered at the thought. She had seen things in London she wished she could forget, homeless children picking food scraps out of the gutter, women selling their frail bodies for coin enough to last another bitter day. The thought of being tossed out of their last place of refuge, a small garret above a hatmaker's shop, into the company of the riffraff and blacklegs in the street was more than she could bear.<br><br>"It's all right, dearest, you mustn't worry," she said, putting on a brave face once more. "Everything has a way of working out." Though Tory was truly beginning to doubt it.<br><br>Claire managed a trembly smile. "I know you'll think of something. You always do." At just-turned-seventeen, Claire Whiting was two years younger but several inches taller than Tory, whose build was more petite. Both girls were slender, but it was Claire who had inherited their mother's stunning good looks.<br><br>She had wavy silver-blond hair that reached nearly to her waist and skin as smooth and pale as an alabaster Venus. Her eyes were so blue they put a clear, Kentish sky to shame. If an angel dressed up in apricot muslin and donned a warm pelisse, she would look like Claire Whiting.<br><br>Tory thought of herself as a more durable sort, with heavy chestnut-brown hair that often curled when she least desired it, clear green eyes and a smattering of freckles. But it wasn't just their looks that set them apart.<br><br>Claire was simply different. She always had been. She inhabited a world mere mortals could not see. Tory always regarded her sister as ethereal, the kind of girl who played with fairies and talked to gnomes.<br><br>Not that she really did those things. It just seemed as if she could.<br><br>What Claire <i>couldn't </i>seem to do was take care of herself in any responsible fashion, so Tory did it for her.<br><br>Which was why they had fled their stepfather, made their way to London and now faced the threat of being cast out into the street.<br><br>To say nothing of being wanted for the theft of the valuable necklace&#x2014;and perhaps even murder.<br><br>A soft August breeze blew in off the Thames, cooling the heat rising up from the cobbled streets. Comfortable in a big four-poster bed, Cordell Easton, fifth earl of Brant, lounged back against the carved wooden headboard. Across from him, Olivia Landers, Viscountess Westland, sat naked on a stool in front of her mirror, slowly pulling a silver-backed hairbrush through her long, straight raven-black hair.<br><br>"Why don't you put down that brush and come back to bed?" Cord drawled. "Once I get through with you, you'll only have to comb it again."<br><br>She turned on the stool and a seductive smile curved her ruby lips. "I thought perhaps you wouldn't be interested again quite so soon." Her eyes ran over his body, sweeping the muscles across his chest, following the thin line of dark hair arrowing down his stomach, coming to rest on his sex. Her eyes widened as she realized he was fully aroused. "Amazing how wrong a woman can be."<br><br>Leaving the stool, she walked toward him, long black hair swinging forward, the only thing hiding her very seductive body, making him harder than he was already.<br><br>Olivia was a widow&#x2014;a very young and tasty widow whom Cord had been seeing for the past several months&#x2014;but she was spoiled and selfish and she was fast becoming more trouble than she was worth. Cord had begun to think of ending the affair.<br><br>Not today, however.<br><br>Today he had stolen a couple of hours away from the stack of papers he had been poring over, badly in need of a diversion. Livy was good for that if nothing more.<br><br>She tossed her black hair over her shoulder as she climbed up onto the deep feather mattress. "I want to be on top," she purred. "I want to make you squirm."<br><br>What she wanted was the same thing she always demanded, rough, hard-pounding sex, and he was just in the mood to give it to her. The problem was, once they were finished, he had begun to feel oddly dissatisfied. He told himself he should cast about for some new female companionship. That always raised his spirits&#x2014; among other parts of his body. But lately, he simply couldn't get into the thrill of the hunt.<br><br>"Cord, you aren't listening." She tugged on a tuft of curly brown chest hair.<br><br>"Sorry, sweeting." But he wasn't really contrite, since he was certain nothing she had to say would interest him in the least. "I was distracted by your very lovely breasts." To which he directed his full attention, taking one of them into his mouth as he lifted her astride him and slid her luscious body the length of his powerful erection.<br><br>Olivia moaned and began to move and Cord lost himself in the sweet charms of her body. Livy peaked and Cord followed, then the pleasure began to fade, disappearing as if it had never existed.<br><br>As Livy climbed from the bed, the thought he'd been having of late began to creep in. <i>Surely there is more than just this.</i><br><br>Cord shoved the thought beneath the dozens of other problems he had been facing since his father had died and he had inherited the Brant title and fortune. Following Olivia out of bed, he began to pull on his clothes. There were a thousand things he needed to do&#x2014;investments he needed to consider, accounts he needed to review, tenant complaints and shipping invoices.<br><br>And there was his ongoing worry about his cousin. Ethan Sharpe had been missing for nearly a year and Cord was determined to find him.<br><br>Still, no matter how busy he was, he always found time for his single great vice&#x2014;women.<br><br>Convinced a new mistress was the answer to his recent bout of gloom, Cord vowed to begin his search.<br><br>"What if it's the curse?" Claire looked at Tory with big blue worried eyes. "You know what people say&#x2014;<br><br>Mama told us a dozen times. She said the necklace could bring very bad fortune to the person who owned it."<br><br>"You're being ridiculous, Claire. There is no such thing as a curse. Besides, we don't own it. We just borrowed it for a while."<br><br>But it had certainly brought misfortune to her stepfather. Tory gnawed her bottom lip as she remembered the baron lying on the floor next to the bureau in Claire's bedchamber, a trickle of blood running from the gash in the side of his head. Dear God, she had prayed every night since it happened that she had not killed him.<br><br>Not that he didn't deserve to die for what he had tried to do.<br><br>"Besides, if you remember the story correctly," Tory added, "it can also bring the owner good fortune."<br><br>"If the person's heart is pure," Claire put in.<br><br>"That's right."<br><br>"We stole it, Tory. That's a sin. Now look what is happening to us. Our money's almost gone. They're going to throw us out of our room. Pretty soon we won't have even enough to buy something to eat."<br><br>"We're just having a little bad luck, is all. It has nothing to do with the curse. And we're bound to find employment very soon."<br><br>Claire looked at her with worried eyes. "Are you sure?"<br><br>"It might not be the sort of work we had hoped for, but yes, I am extremely sure." She wasn't, of course, but she didn't want Claire's hopes to plummet any lower than they were already. Besides, she <i>would </i>find work. No matter what she had to do.<br><br>But three more days passed and still nothing turned up. Tory had blisters on her feet and there was a rip in the hem of her high-waisted dove-gray gown.<br><br><i>Today is the day, </i>she told herself, summoning a renewed determination as they headed once more for the area she believed most likely to provide employment. For more than a week, they had knocked on doors in London's fashionable West End, certain some wealthy family would be in need of a governess. But so far, nothing had turned up.<br><br>Climbing what must have been the hundredth set of porch stairs, Tory lifted the heavy brass knocker, gave it several firm raps, then listened as the sound echoed into the house. A few minutes later, a skinny, black-haired butler with a thin mustache opened the heavy front door.<br><br>"I should like to speak to the mistress of the house, if you please."<br><br>"In what regard, madam, may I ask?"<br><br>"I am seeking employment as a governess. One of the kitchen maids down the block said that Lady Pither-ing has three children and may be in need of one."<br><br>The butler's gaze took in the frayed cuffs and the rip in her hem and lifted his nose into the air. He opened his mouth to send her away when his gaze lit on Claire. She was smiling in that sweet way of hers, looking for all the world like an angel fallen to earth.<br><br>"We both love children," Claire said, still smiling. "And Tory is ever so smart. She would make the very best of governesses. I am also looking for work. We were hoping you might be able to help us."<br><br>The butler just kept staring at Claire and Claire kept on smiling.<br><br>Tory cleared her throat and the skinny man dragged his gaze away from Claire back to Tory. "Go round to the back door and I shall let you speak to the housekeeper. That is the best I can do."<br><br>Tory nodded, grateful to have gotten even that far, but a few minutes later, when they returned to the front of the house, she was filled with an even deeper despair.<br><br>"The butler was ever so nice," Claire said. "I thought for certain this time&#x2014;"<br><br>"You heard what the housekeeper said. Lady Pither-ing is looking for someone older." And there never seemed to be a job for a servant as lovely as Claire.<br><br>Claire gnawed her bottom lip. "I'm hungry, Tory. I know you said we have to wait till supper, but my stomach is making all sorts of unladylike noises. Can't we have a little something now?"<br><br>Tory closed her eyes, trying to resurrect some of her earlier courage. She couldn't stand the look in her sister's eyes, the worry mingled with fear. She simply could not tell her they had spent their very last farthing, that until they found work of some kind they couldn't buy so much as a dry crust of bread.<br><br>"Just a bit longer, darling. Let's try the place the housekeeper mentioned down the block."<br><br>"But she said Lord Brant doesn't have any children."<br><br>"It doesn't matter. We'll take whatever jobs we can find." She forced herself to smile. "I'm sure it won't be for long."<br><br>Claire nodded bravely and Tory wanted to cry. She had hoped to take care of her younger sister. While Tory had often worked long hours at the day-to-day task of running Harwood Hall, Claire wasn't used to the hard work done by a servant. Tory had hoped to spare her sister, but fate had led them to this dismal place in their lives and it looked as if they would have to do whatever it took to survive.<br><br>"Which one is it?" Claire asked.<br><br>"The big brick house just over there. Do you see those two stone lions on the porch? That is the residence of the earl of Brant."<br><br>Claire studied the elegant town house, larger than any other on the block, and a hopeful smile blossomed on her face.<br><br>"Perhaps Lord Brant will be handsome and kind as well as rich," she said dreamily. "And you shall marry him and both of us will be saved."<br><br>Tory flashed her an indulgent smile. "For now, let us simply hope the man is in need of a servant or two and willing to take us in."<br><br>But again they were turned away, this time by a short, bald-headed butler with thick shoulders and beady little eyes.<br><br>Claire was crying by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs, which was a rare thing, indeed, and enough to make Tory want to cry along with her. Funny thing was, if Tory cried, her nose got all red and her lips wobbled. But with Claire, it just made her eyes look bigger and bluer and her cheeks bloomed with roses.<br><br>Tory grabbed her reticule and began trying to dig out a handkerchief for Claire when one magically appeared in front of her face. Her sister accepted it gratefully. Dabbing it against her eyes, she turned her sweet, angelic smile upon the man who had provided it.<br><br>"Thank you ever so much."<br><br>The man returned the smile as Tory could have guessed he would. "Cordell Easton, earl of Brant, at your service, dear lady. And you would be...?"<br><br>He was looking at Claire the way men had since she was twelve years old. Tory didn't think he realized there was anyone else there but Claire.<br><br>"I am Miss Claire Temple and this is my sister, Victoria." Tory silently thanked God that Claire had remembered to use their mother's maiden name, and ignored her sister's disregard of the proper rules of introduction. The man was, after all, the earl, and they were desperately in need of his employment.</p><h2>The Code of the Samurai</h2><p><p>Beautifully produced in traditional Chinese binding with a cloth cover and string, and with a timeless design, this book includes the classic Inazo text with a new introduction. It will appeal to anyone interested in leadership, the nobility of the Samurai and Japanese culture.</p><br>Bushido is the chivalric code of moral principles that the Samurai followed: rectitude, frugality, courage, benevolence, respect, honesty, honour and loyalty. Influenced by Confucianism, Shinto and Zen Buddhism, it tempers the violence of a warrior with wisdom and serenity. Alongside Sun Tzu&#x2019;s <i>The Art of War</i> and Machiavelli&#x2019;s <i>The Prince</i>, Inazo&#x2019;s book has become influential among military and corporate leaders looking for ways to manage their people and overcome their opponents.<br><br>The term bushido was originally used in the 17th Century and came into common use around the world after the original publication of this book in 1899. In the tradition of the Kojiki, the Heike Monogatari, and The Book of Five Rings, this collection of principles sheds a great deal of clarity on the evolution of the Japanese Samurai culture.&nbsp;</p><p>Inazo Nitobe was a scholar, educator, diplomat and statesman.

His work has also been published by DC Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and Marvel. He lives with his family in New York City.<i><b>School Library Journal</b></i><b> Starred Review<br></b>Keenan has created an exhilarating and suspenseful set of stories about three soldiers and their dogs while also&nbsp;giving a general overview of different wars and touching on some period political and cultural events. Donnie and his dog, Boots, are medics lost deep in the trenches of World War I, trying to find their platoon. Rescuers stationed in Greenland, Cooper and his dog, Loki, are sent to save a downed World War II pilot. The book ends with the compelling story of Lanford, a vet back from Vietnam suffering from flashbacks of his scout dog, Sheba. These relationships feel genuine and are well developed, showing the training process and the reliance each one had with the&nbsp; other in order to stay alive. By the end, readers will feel that these dogs were not just helpers, but true soldiers worthy of honor. Fox&#x2019;s illustrations do a wonderful job of showing the devastating nature of these conflicts without sensationalized violence. The backgrounds are exceptional, showing the extremes of each story&#x2019;s harsh and dangerous environment. A prologue gives more information about each war and a history of solider dogs up to present day. This stunning graphic novel will be a hit with reluctant readers and history lovers.<br><br><i><b>The Bulletin&nbsp;of the Center for Children's Books</b></i><b> Starred Review<br></b>The title may prioritize dogs, but these three historical fiction stories in this graphic novel actually focus more strongly on the men who served with those dogs in three different wars. In &#x201c;Boots,&#x201d; sixteen-year-old Marcellinus McDonald is a doctor&#x2019;s assistant on the Western Front in 1914, and Boots is his beloved &#x201c;mercy dog,&#x201d; who finds the wounded in No Man&#x2019;s Land. &#x201c;Loki&#x201d; is a sled dog in a rescue unit stationed in 1942 Greenland, where his master relies on him in a solo encounter with some reconnoitering Nazis. The final story, &#x201c;Sheba,&#x201d; follows young Henry in 1968 North Carolina as his struggles with his obstreperous beagle pup bring him friendship with a recently returned Vietnam vet haunted by his experience on patrol with his German shepherd, Sheba. Keenan creates vivid voices for her characters, effectively tucking in exposition to convey information about everything from military objectives to daily life details in three very different situations. There&#x2019;s action aplenty, but the rhythms and trajectories vary effectively: &#x201c;Boots&#x201d; is a classic story of the Christmas Truce; &#x201c;Loki&#x201d; is an adventure tale of intelligence and hand-to-hand combat; &#x201c;Sheba,&#x201d; which could stand alone as a book in its own right, is a poignant tale of male bonding between a young fatherless African-American boy and a black soldier overwhelmed by his experiences. Though the chaos of the action scenes can make them difficult to read, the art is atmospheric and effective, blending cinematic heroism, especially in the portraits of the dogs, with often daunting realism. Diehard warmongers, dog fans, and graphic-novel readers will all find something new here, and this will be an easy booktalk to readers reluctant and otherwise.&nbsp;</p><h2>Crazy Rich Asians</h2><p><i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> is the outrageously funny debut novel about three super-rich, pedigreed Chinese families and the gossip, backbiting, and scheming that occurs when the heir to one of the most massive fortunes in Asia brings home his ABC (American-born Chinese) girlfriend to the wedding of the season.<br>When Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her boyfriend, Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home, long drives to explore the island, and quality time with the man she might one day marry. What she doesn't know is that Nick's family home happens to look like a palace, that she'll ride in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's most eligible bachelors on her arm, Rachel might as well have a target on her back. Initiated into a world of dynastic splendor beyond imagination, Rachel meets Astrid, the It Girl of Singapore society; Eddie, whose family practically lives in the pages of the Hong Kong socialite magazines; and Eleanor, Nick's formidable mother, a woman who has very strong feelings about who her son should--and should not--marry. Uproarious, addictive, and filled with jaw-dropping opulence, <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> is an insider's look at the Asian JetSet; a perfect depiction of the clash between old money and new money; between Overseas Chinese and Mainland Chinese; and a fabulous novel about what it means to be young, in love, and gloriously, <i>crazily</i> rich.</p><p>Kevin Kwan was born and raised in Singapore.

She paused, thinking Nick might invite her in for a drink, but no invitation seemed forthcoming. Finally she said as nonchalantly as possible, &#x201c;This is quite a place&#x2014;is it your grandmother&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Nick replied.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Has she lived here a long time?&#x201d; Peik Lin asked, craning to get a better look.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Since she was a young girl.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Peik Lin really wanted to ask was,&nbsp;<i>Who on earth is your grandmother?</i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, you two have a great time,&#x201d; she said instead, winking at Rachel and mouthing&nbsp;<i>Call me later.</i>&nbsp;Rachel gave her friend a quick smile.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick turned to Rachel, looking a little sheepish. &#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s OK . . . but it&#x2019;s not just the family. My grandmother decided to have a small party at the last minute because her&nbsp;<i>tan hua</i>&nbsp;flowers are going to bloom tonight.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;She&#x2019;s throwing a party because some flowers are in bloom?&#x201d; Rachel asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, these are very rare. They bloom only about once every decade, and only at night. The whole thing lasts just a few hours. It&#x2019;s quite something.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sounds cool, but now I&#x2019;m feeling really underdressed,&#x201d; Rachel said, eyeing the fleet of limousines lining the driveway. She was wearing a sleeveless, chocolate-colored linen dress, a pair of low-heeled sandals, and the only expensive piece of jewelry she owned&#x2014;Mikimoto pearl studs that her mother had given her when she got her doctorate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not at all&#x2014;you look absolutely perfect,&#x201d; Nick replied.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they entered the house, Rachel was transfixed for a few moments by the intricate black, blue, and coral mosaic tile pattern on the floor of what appeared to be a large foyer. Then, to her amazement, a tall, spindly Indian man standing next to a table clustered with pots of enormous white-and-purple phalaenopsis orchids bowed ceremoniously to her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s upstairs in the living room,&#x201d; Nick said, leading Rachel toward a carved-stone staircase. She saw something out of the corner of her eye and let out a quick gasp. By the side of the staircase lurked a huge tiger, mouth open in a ferocious growl.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It looks so real!&#x201d; Rachel said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;real,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a native Singaporean tiger. They used to roam this area. My great-grandfather shot it when it ran into the house and hid under the billiard table, or so the story goes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Poor guy,&#x201d; Rachel said.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It used to scare the hell out of me when I was little. I never dared go near the foyer at night,&#x201d; Nick said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You grew up here?&#x201d; Rachel asked in surprise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, until I was about seven.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You never told me you lived in a palace.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t a palace. It&#x2019;s just a big house.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nick, where I come from, this is a palace,&#x201d; Rachel said, gazing up at the cast-iron-and-glass cupola soaring above them. The murmur of party chatter and piano keys wafted down. As they entered the drawing room, Rachel felt momentarily giddy, as if she had been transported back in time to the grand lounge of a twenties ocean liner, en route from Venice to Istanbul, perhaps.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The &#x201c;living room,&#x201d; as Nick so modestly called it, was a gallery that ran along the entire northern end of the house, with Art Deco divans, wicker club chairs, and ottomans casually grouped into intimate seating areas. A row of tall plantation doors opened onto a veranda, inviting a view of verdant parklands and the scent of night-blooming jasmine into the room. At the far end of the room a young man in a tuxedo played on a B�sendorfer grand piano. Rachel longed to study every exquisite detail: the exotic potted palms in massive Qianlong dragon jardinieres, the lacquered teak surfaces, the silver-and-lapis-lazuli-filigreed walls. The glamorous guests, she couldn&#x2019;t help noticing, appeared completely at ease lounging on the shantung silk ottomans while a retinue of white-gloved servants circulated with trays of cocktails.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Here comes my cousin Astrid&#x2019;s mother,&#x201d; Nick muttered. A stately-&nbsp;looking lady approached them, wagging a finger at Nick.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nicky, you naughty boy, why didn&#x2019;t you tell us you were back?&#x201d; The woman spoke in a clipped English accent straight out of a Merchant Ivory film. Rachel couldn&#x2019;t help but notice how her tightly permed black hair fittingly resembled the Queen of England&#x2019;s.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So sorry, I thought you and Uncle Harry would be in London at this time of the year.&nbsp;<i>Dai gu cheh</i>, this is my girlfriend, Rachel Chu. Rachel, this is my auntie Felicity Leong.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felicity nodded at Rachel, boldly scanning her up and down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So nice to meet you,&#x201d; Rachel said, unsettled by her hawklike gaze.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is Astrid here yet?&#x201d; Nick asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Aiyah</i>, you know that girl is always late!&#x201d; At that moment, his aunt noticed an elderly Indian woman in a gold-and-peacock-blue sari being helped up the stairs. &#x201c;Dear Mrs. Singh, when did you get back from Udaipur?&#x201d; she screeched, pouncing on the woman as Nick guided Rachel out of the way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who is that lady?&#x201d; Rachel asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Mrs. Singh, a family friend who used to live down the street. She&#x2019;s the daughter of a maharaja and was great friends with Nehru. I&#x2019;ll introduce you later, when my aunt isn&#x2019;t breathing down our necks.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Her sari is absolutely stunning,&#x201d; Rachel remarked, gazing at the elaborate gold stitching.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I hear she flies all her saris back to New Delhi to be specially cleaned,&#x201d; Nick said as he tried to escort Rachel toward the bar, unwittingly steering her into the path of a very posh-looking middle-aged couple. The man had a pompadour of Brylcreemed black hair while his wife wore a classic gold-buttoned red-and-white Chanel suit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Uncle Dickie, Auntie Nancy, meet my girlfriend, Rachel Chu,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;Rachel, this is my uncle and his wife, from the T&#x2019;sien side of the family.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, Rachel, I&#x2019;ve met your grandfather in Taipei . . . Chu Yang Chung, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Uncle Dickie asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Er . . . actually, no. My family isn&#x2019;t from Taipei,&#x201d; Rachel stammered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh. Where are they from, then?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Guangdong originally, and nowadays California.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle Dickie looked a bit taken aback, while his well-coiffed wife grasped his arm tightly and continued. &#x201c;Oh, we know California very well. Northern California, actually.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m from,&#x201d; Rachel replied politely.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, well then, you must know the Gettys? Ann is a great friend of mine,&#x201d; Nancy effused.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Um, are you referring to the Getty Oil family?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is there any other?&#x201d; Nancy asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Rachel&#x2019;s from Cupertino, not San Francisco, Auntie Nancy. And that&#x2019;s why I need to introduce her to Francis Leong over there, who I hear is going to Stanford this fall,&#x201d; Nick cut in, quickly moving Rachel along. The next half hour was a blur of nonstop greetings, as Rachel was introduced to aunties and uncles and cousins, the distinguished though diminutive Thai ambassador, and the sultan of some unpronounceable Malay state, along with his two wives in bejeweled head scarves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One woman seemed to command the attention of the room. She was very slim and aristocratic-looking with snow-white hair and ramrod-straight posture, dressed in a long white silk cheongsam. Most of the guests orbited around her, paying tribute, and when she at last came toward them, Rachel noticed Nick&#x2019;s resemblance to her. Rachel decided to greet her in Mandarin, but before Nick could make proper introductions, she bowed her head nervously and said, &#x201c;It is such a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for inviting me to your beautiful home.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman looked at her quizzically and replied slowly in Mandarin, &#x201c;It is a pleasure to meet you, too, but you are mistaken; this is not my house.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Rachel, this is my great-aunt Rosemary,&#x201d; Nick explained hurriedly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And you&#x2019;ll have to forgive me, my Mandarin is really quite rusty,&#x201d; Great-Aunt Rosemary added in a Vanessa Redgrave English.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; Rachel said, her cheeks flushing bright red. She could feel all eyes in the room upon her, amused by her faux pas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No need to apologize.&#x201d; Great-Aunt Rosemary smiled graciously. &#x201c;Nick has told me quite a bit about you, and I was so looking forward to meeting you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick put his arm around Rachel and said, &#x201c;Here, come meet my grandmother.&#x201d; They walked across the room, and on the sofa closest to the veranda sat an older woman dressed simply in a rose-colored silk blouse and tailored cream trousers, her steel-gray hair held in place by an ivory headband. Standing behind her were two ladies in immaculate matching gowns of iridescent silk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick addressed his grandmother in Cantonese. &#x201c;<i>Ah ma</i>, I&#x2019;d like you to meet my friend Rachel Chu, from America.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So nice to meet you!&#x201d; Rachel blurted, forgetting her Mandarin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nick&#x2019;s grandmother peered up at Rachel. &#x201c;Thank you for coming,&#x201d; she replied haltingly, in English, before turning to resume her conversation with a woman at her side. The two ladies swathed in silk stared inscrutably at Rachel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get some punch,&#x201d; Nick said, directing Rachel toward a table dominated by a huge Venetian glass punch bowl.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That had to be the most awkward moment of my life,&#x201d; Rachel whispered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nonsense. She was just in the middle of another conversation,&#x201d; Nick said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who were those two elegant women in matching silk dresses standing like statues behind her?&#x201d; Rachel asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Her lady&#x2019;s maids. They never leave her side. They&#x2019;re from Thailand and were trained to serve in the royal court.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is this a common thing in Singapore? Importing royal maids from Thailand?&#x201d; Rachel asked incredulously.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe so. This service was a special lifetime gift to my grandmother.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A gift? From whom?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The King of Thailand.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Rachel said. She took the glass of punch from Nick and noticed that the fine etching on the Venetian glassware perfectly matched the intricate fretwork pattern on the ceiling. She leaned against the back of a sofa for support.There was so much for her to take in. Who knew that Nick&#x2019;s family would turn out to be so grand? And why hadn&#x2019;t he prepared her better?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rachel felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned around to see Nick&#x2019;s cousin, Astrid Leong, holding a sleepy toddler. &#x201c;Astrid!&#x201d; she cried, delighted to see a friendly face. Astrid was wearing the chicest outfit Rachel had ever seen&#x2014;an embroidered Alexis Mabille white peasant blouse, pearl-gray Lanvin cigarette pants, and a fantastical pair of bejeweled earrings, very Millicent Rogers. So this was Astrid in her natural habitat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hello, hello!&#x201d; Astrid said cheerily. &#x201c;Cassian, say hi to Auntie Rachel.&#x201d; The child stared at Rachel, then buried his head into his mother&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;how are you finding Singapore so far? Having a good time?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A great time! Although tonight&#x2019;s been a bit . . . overwhelming.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I can only imagine,&#x201d; Astrid said with a knowing glint in her eye.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A melodious peal rang out. An elderly woman in a white cheongsam top and black silk trousers was playing a small silver xylophone by the stairs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Ah, the dinner gong,&#x201d; Astrid said. &#x201c;Come, let&#x2019;s eat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;nb...</p></p><h2>Ghost Dance (Star Trek Voyager, No 20, Dark Matters Book Two of Three)</h2><p>As the Romulans attempt to uncover the secret of &#34;dark matter&#34; from a contaminated and ailing Voyager, Captain Janeway and her crew set out to retrace their journey to recover lost quantities of the cosmic force, racing against time to stop the complete annihilation that is threatening two separate realities. Original.</p><p><p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p><br> The sweet, thick smoke from the burning leaves of the Sacred Plant wafted upward, wrapping the Culil in its gray embrace. Culil Matroci struggled not to cough, instead telling himself that the smoke was holy, it purified him, and it was only his weak, fleshly lungs attempting to resist the presence of the Divine. </p><p> If only he had the courage, as the Culil before him had, to lock himself into a closed room and let the holy smoke from the Sacred Plant fill up those fleshly lungs until he was entirely one with the spirit world. But Matroci was young, and sometimes the delights of the flesh were sweeter to him than the smoke of the Sacred Plant. </p><p> <i>Sacrilege!</i> his training screamed at him, and inwardly Matroci quailed at his lapse. Tonight, before he snatched what little sleep his position permitted, he would have to spend an extra session with the Sacred Plant smoke to purge himself of his blasphemy. </p><p> Still, he always kept a window open. </p><p> It was the Strangers who had done this to him, unsettled him so that he could not think with the peace and clarity that a Culil ought. It was not unusual for the Culilann to meet beings from other worlds, though it had seldom happened in Matroci's village of Sumar-ka. Was that not the first of the ninety-nine Chants? "Never think you are alone. The works of the Crafters are multitude, and little have you seen of them." Such encounters often proved mutually beneficial. Of course, that was after the Ordeal had been completed, something any representatives of a completely new race must undergo. This time, the Ordeal was proving to be precisely that, and Matroci could not find it in him to approve. </p><p> Despite his efforts, Matroci found himself thinking about them, even though this was supposed to be a time of deepest prayer and inward contemplation. His sanctuary, large and roomy to befit his august office, was decorated with furnishings of both grace and utility. Handcrafted, of course, to honor the Crafters. Only the Alilann artificially manufactured anything. Such unimaginative products were scorned by true Culilann, and the Culil would lose his office if he dared allow them in the sanctuary. So for the comfort of the Culil there were pillows and rugs upon which to recline, woven and sewn and stuffed by those who cared for the soft-furred <i>simli</i>, chairs crafted from the trunks of the Sacred Plant as well as other woods, bowls and cups spun on a turning wheel while clever fingers worked them into objects of almost unspeakable beauty. Beverages, pressed by steady tramping feet, filled those cups; fruits and vegetables harvested by free-hearted labor adorned the table, waiting to be consumed. </p><p> Sometimes, Matroci wondered why the Culil accepted such beautiful things when his position required him to mortify his flesh and shun such niceties. The dictates of the Crafters were sometimes rather confusing. On the one hand, it was clear in the writings that the Culil was not to take active pleasure in gifts. On the other, it was also written that the people were to honor the Culil with the labor of their hearts and hands, thus also honoring the Crafters. So Matroci was in the awkward position of having to accept gifts he was forbidden to truly use and enjoy. </p><p> He sometimes wished he were not so high ranking. He'd have fewer pretty things, but at least then he could appreciate them openly and honestly as the rest of the Culilann did. </p><p> The smoke was dissipating, thank the Crafters. His lungs still burned, but not quite so much as before. After a few more moments, the fire had consumed all the dried leaves, and there was only the faintest trace of their sweet scent clinging to Matroci's heavy robes and long, pale blue hair. </p><p> He prostrated himself in front of the altar, asked forgiveness for his wayward thoughts, and rose. He bathed his face with the herb-scented water and let it dry on his blue-hued skin. Droplets traced their way down his shaven chin and neck and past his high collar, and the cool dampness was annoying. </p><p> Trials, that's all every hour brought. More tests, more trials of his faith. Matroci wished he were not quite so young. It seemed that the Elders were much more entrenched in the faith than he was. </p><p> He rose, stretched, poured himself a cool drink from one of those beautifully wrought pitchers, and sipped the tangy beverage slowly. He tried not to think about how delicious it was, and how beautifully made was the goblet that held it. </p><p> There was a soft knock on his door. Matroci sighed and called, "Enter." </p><p> It was Trima, his Sa-Culil. She stood straight and tall, her long blue hair falling past her buttocks. Since the day she was pledged to the Crafters, Trima had never cut it. It was an old tradition, hardly followed much anymore. Matroci himself had been forced to cut his long locks a few turns ago when he'd gotten them hopelessly snarled, but as far as he knew, Trima had proudly let her hair grow longer and longer, untouched by shears if not by comb. </p><p> It was thick and glossy and quite beautiful, and not for the first time Matroci wondered what its heavy lengths would feel like between his fingers. But Trima was his responsibility, and he would no more act on his feelings than he would leap off the thatched roof thinking he could fly. </p><p> He placed his fingers first on his temples, then on his throat, then on his belly in the ritual threefold gesture that Trima always expected. She returned it in kind, executing the movements with exquisite grace. </p><p> "Greetings, Sa-Culil," said Matroci. "What is it you require of me? It is not time for your training sessions." </p><p> "No, good Culil." Her voice was as sweet as the bell that rang to call them all to prayer at sunsrise. She paused for a moment and inhaled deeply, breathing what remained of the sacred smoke. <i>She never coughs</i>, Matroci thought sourly. </p><p> "I come from Soliss. He tells me that the Strangers are not healing well, despite the holy waters with which they have been anointed and the prayers we have said for them, even though they are -- " </p><p> Her voice caught, and her eyes widened a little. Matroci felt for her then. Trima liked to project such an image of peace, of tranquility. She had been the one to find the Strangers, wandering bleeding on the holy ground, and the whole incident had clearly upset her. Their torn, broken bodies were nothing of peace and tranquility. </p><p> But the words of the Crafters were clear. These were Strangers of the most terrifying sort, utterly unknown, and the Culilann were not to provide any aid other than spiritual for a certain number of days. If they survived, then the Culilann would attend to their physical needs with all the hospitality the Crafters bade them show. If they died, then the Crafters had spoken. </p><p> Personally, Matroci didn't like it any better than Trima seemed to, but there wasn't much he could do. Soliss, the Minister of the small village, was the worst of all. It was in him to heal, and to sit by and watch anyone suffer, even Strangers as alien as these two, must be awful. </p><p> A thought came to him. "They must eat of the Sacred Fruit," he said. </p><p> Trima frowned primly, if such a thing were possible. "That is a rare sacrament, as you must surely know, Culil. Even we who are called to serve the Crafters do not partake other than at Midtime." </p><p> "We are bound to offer spiritual aid," said Matroci, standing up straighter. "Surely letting them partake of the Sacred Fruit is offering such aid." </p><p> "Yes, but -- " </p><p> "Who is Culil, Trima?" </p><p> She colored at that, pale blue suffusing her soft, rounded cheeks. "You are, of course." </p><p> "You will do well to remember that," he said, with a harshness he did not feel. "Your tenure of trial is not yet over. Another could still take your place." </p><p> The color that had rushed to her pretty face now ebbed and her eyes opened wide in horror. Matroci regretted his words at once, but he had to admit, they had produced the desired effect. A Sa-Culil preoccupied with keeping her position was a Sa-Culil not inclined to challenge him. Normally, he did not mind her chastisements thinly disguised as innocent comments. He even enjoyed them. It kept him sharp, having so keen a student. </p><p> But the Strangers, the Strangers! It would seem that they were changing everything. </p><p> "Go and carry out my wishes, Sa-Culil Trima. See to it that the Strangers have plenty of the fruit, that they may fill themselves with righteousness." <i>And fill starving, aching bellies with something that might help them survive, he thought grimly.</i> </p><p> Obediently Trima made the threefold gesture and backed out of his so-called radiant presence. She closed the two doors behind her, eyes on the floor. </p><p> Matroci stared at the door for some time after she had gone. Trima was right. He was playing with fire, twisting the words of the Crafters in such a way. Passing the fruit of the Sacred Plant off as spiritual aid was dangerously close to blasphemy. He bent his aching knees onto the soft pillow for another round of prayers. </p><p><br> There was silence from the pit. Soliss's gut wrenched as he approached. Perhaps they had fallen into an uneasy sleep at last, worn out with lack of food, of water, of care for their infected wounds. Blasphemous though he knew it to be, there were times when he despised the words of the Crafters, and never more than now. </p><p> He felt eyes upon him and knew that the rest of the village was watching his every move. Even though it was part of their faith that all had a calling and no one should be jealous of another, he knew that folk mistrusted his gift for healing. It skirted the line between the Culilann and the Alilann. His herbs smacked of artificially manufactured medicines, his knowledge of anatomy, of scientific curiosity and skill. Unlike the potters and weavers and artists, Ministers, as the Culilann called their healers, were the only ones with a counterpart in the Alilann caste. </p><p> And were, therefore, not to be trusted. </p><p> His visiting the Strangers so frequently was certain to be noted and commented upon, perhaps even to the Culil himself. Still, Soliss strode forward boldly, his head held high and his spine straight. Let them say what they would. He had to be true to himself. </p><p> He slowed as he approached the pit. Would that the long days of the Ordeal had passed and he could haul away the grate that covered it. As it was, he knelt beside the hole in the earth, shielded his eyes from the light of his planet's twin suns, and peered down. </p><p> The slighter one was asleep, his broken arm cradled protectively against his chest. Soliss did not know what the alien's race looked like when well, so the red spots on the cheeks that seemed almost gray could be normal. He doubted it. He did not need to be familiar with the Stranger's species to know fever when he saw it. </p><p> The other one, heavier of build, glanced up as Soliss's shadow fell across the grate. He, too, was injured, but appeared more hale than his compatriot. Still, the ragged tears in his abdomen wanted attention. Soliss felt a brief surge of fury that he was forbidden to give it. </p><p> "Greetings," he said. </p><p> "Good morning," said the Stranger with a hint of irony in his deep, smooth voice. "Lovely weather you have here on this planet. Glad it hasn't rained." </p><p> Soliss felt the moisture in the air and glanced up at the growing clouds. "It will," he said. "How is he?" he asked, nodding toward the sleeping Stranger. </p><p> "He's not well, as I know you know. His wound is infected and the broken arm needs to be set before it starts trying to heal itself improperly." He turned his face back up to Soliss. In the bright morning light, Soliss could make out strange lines that were apparently painted on the being's left temple. "I wish you'd tell me your name. You're the only one who has come to see us. I'd like to address you properly." </p><p> Without realizing it, Soliss sat up straighter, unconsciously putting more distance between himself and the wounded Strangers. </p><p> "I am no one. You are Strangers. That is all we need to say to each other." </p><p> The alien stepped closer to the side of the pit. At the movement, his fellow woke up and groaned a little. "That's the worst coffee substitute you've come up with yet," he muttered, then lapsed into fevered slumber once more. </p><p> The dark-haired alien looked at him, then up again at Soliss. </p><p> "You wouldn't be coming here so often if you weren't concerned. Please, he needs help!" </p><p> Soliss rose and stepped away. The pleading of the Stranger was torment. He turned and almost collided with the small, lithe form of Trima. She was carrying a tray with some sort of fruit on it. </p><p> "Oh!" she gasped. Quickly Soliss reached out and steadied the tray. "Thank you." </p><p> Soliss looked at the fruit. He didn't recognize it. "Sa-Culil, what is this? Why have you brought this to me?" </p><p> She met his gaze evenly and with a hint of scorn. "I bring the fruit of the Sacred Plant not for you, Soliss the Minister, but for the Strangers." </p><p> Soliss gaped. So, the lumpy green things on the tray were the fabled fruit of the Sacred Plant. They didn't look particularly appetizing. </p><p> "I have never seen these before," he said. </p><p> "Of course not. You are not a member of the religious order. Only we may partake of it." </p><p> The awe that Soliss felt evaporated in the face of Trima's snobbery. "Then why are you wasting it on Strangers?" </p><p> Trima looked displeased. "Culil Matroci orders it. He says that the holy writings order us to give spiritual aid to these Strangers, and that feeding them the Sacred Fruit is doing exactly that." </p><p> "But you don't agree?" </p><p> She didn't answer. She didn't have to. Frankly, Soliss could not care less if the Culil's decision sat well or ill with Trima. All he knew was that for the first time in days, these injured and perhaps dying aliens were permitted sustenance. He grabbed the fruits off the tray, ignoring Trima's indignant yelp, and knelt beside the grate. </p><p> The alien gazed up on him. "So you're Soliss the Minister," he said. His dark eyes fell upon the fruit. "Is that what I think it is?" </p><p> "It's the fruit of the Sacred Plant," Soliss said. </p><p> "It's food. I thought we weren't supposed to have food." </p><p> "It's spiritual ministering," Soliss said, a touch too forcefully. "You must eat it slowly, and think of holy things. It will please the Crafters." He didn't want to just toss the food in there. Seeing no alternative, Soliss lay down and pushed an arm through one of the grate's gaps. </p><p> "I will think of holy things," said the Stranger as he reached up to take the fruit, "but I can't guarantee I'll eat it slowly." </p><p> Their fingers brushed as the stranger took the fruit. Five fingers to a hand and an opposable thumb, just like Soliss's. His build was the same, the eyes, nose, and mouth in the same place. They were very much alike. It was unsettling. </p><p> Soliss handed down the rest of the fruit, then edged back and stood. The Stranger, despite his claim, didn't eat immediately. His dark-eyed gaze locked with Soliss's blue one. </p><p> "You are Soliss," he said again. "I have a name, too, as does my friend. The naming of a thing is powerful in my religious tradition." </p><p> "I do not wish to hear it," said Soliss, mindful of the disapproving presence of Trima only a few steps away. </p><p> "But I will say it, and then you will know. My name is Chakotay, and my companion is Tom Paris." </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2000 by Paramount Pictures.

A pulsing rock beat suddenly shakes the arena as action shots of the Heartbreak Kid flash across the Titantron, the massive screen suspended over the ring. The crowd cheers, leaping up as Shawn Michaels, in jeans and an army-green shirt, whirls onstage, his long, blond hair flying. Pyrotechnics explode. The deafening sound system growls, &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;m sexy . . . I got the looks . . . that drive the girls wild. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Michaels bursts into the ring, fists pumping, stalking back and forth. The ref steps in to begin the match.<br><br>&#x201c;HBK! HBK! HBK!&#x201d; chants the crowd.<br><br>&#x201c;Hold on, hold on, referee,&#x201d; Layfield says, putting his hand on the referee&#x2019;s shoulder. People in the crowd begin to heckle.<br><br>&#x201c;Shawn,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;you got a choice to make. You can either fight me right now in this street fight, or you can do the right thing for you, your family, and your extended family, and take care of them in a financial crisis you never dreamed would happen a year ago today.&#x201d;<br><br>Michaels stands silently.<br><br>&#x201c;You see, I know some things, Shawn,&#x201d; continues Layfield. &#x201c;Rich people always do. Before this stock market crashed, nobody saw it coming, except, of course, my wife, but that didn&#x2019;t help you, did it? See, I was hoarding cash. I was putting money in gold. While most Americans followed the leader&#x2013;blindly, stupidly followed the leader&#x2013;I was making money. In fact, Shawn, I was prospering while you were following the herd, losing almost everything, right, Shawn?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fight!! Fight!! Fight!! Fight!!&#x201d; urges the crowd. Michaels looks hesitantly back and forth between the heaving crowd and Layfield.<br><br>&#x201c;You lost your 401(k). You lost your retirement. You lost your nest egg. You lost <i>your children&#x2019;s education fund</i>,&#x201d; Layfield bellows into the mic, his face inches from Michaels&#x2019;s. &#x201c;You got to support your extended family, Shawn, and now you look around with all this responsibility, and you look at your beautiful wife, she&#x2019;s a beautiful lady, you look at your two little wonderful kids, and you wonder: &#x2018;How in the world . . . am I going to send them . . . to college?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Layfield pauses heavily. Michaels&#x2019; face is slack, pained. Small, individual voices shout out from the crowd.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ve got an answer,&#x201d; Layfield goes on. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m offering you a job. I want you to come work&#x2013;for <i>me</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No! No! No!&#x201d; yells the crowd. Michaels blinks slowly, dazed, and lowers his eyes to the mat.<br><br>&#x201c;See, there&#x2019;s always alternatives, Shawn. There&#x2019;s alternatives to everything. You can always wrestle until you&#x2019;re fifty. You might even wrestle till you&#x2019;re sixty. In fact, you could be a lot like these has-beens who are disgracing themselves in high school gyms all over the country, bragging about their war stories of selling the place out while they&#x2019;re hawking their eight-by-tens and selling Polaroids. Shawn, you could be that guy, or you could take my offer, because I promise you this: All the revenue that you&#x2019;re goin&#x2019; to make off your DX T-shirts will not compare to the offer that I . . . made . . . to you.&#x201d;<br><br>He tells the Heartbreak Kid to look in the mirror, adding, &#x201c;The years haven&#x2019;t been kind to you, have they, Shawn?&#x201d; He reminds him that one more bad fall, one more injury, and &#x201c;you&#x2019;re done, you&#x2019;re done.&#x201d;<br><br>The crowd begins to rally their stunned hero, growing louder and louder. &#x201c;HBK! HBK! HBK!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What else can you really do besides this?&#x201d; Layfield asks. &#x201c;You get a second chance in life.&#x201d;<br><br>Layfield sweeps off his white Stetson. &#x201c;Go ahead,&#x201d; he screams into Michaels&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Ever since you walked out here . . . people have been wantin&#x2019; you to kick me in the face. So why don&#x2019;t you do it? I&#x2019;m gonna give you a free shot, Shawn, right here.&#x201d;<br><br>The crowd erupts, roaring for the Heartbreak Kid to strike.<br><br>&#x201c;HBK!! DO IT!! DO IT!! HBK!! HBK!!!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Listen to &#x2019;em. Everybody wants it. Shawn, it&#x2019;s what you want. You&#x2019;re twitching. You&#x2019;re begging to pull the trigger, so I&#x2019;m telling you right now, take a shot! Take it!&#x201d;<br><br>The Heartbreak Kid takes one step back, his stubbled face trembling, breathing rapidly like a rabbit. The crowd is leaping out of their seats, thrusting their arms in the air, holding up handmade banners.<br><br>&#x201c;HBK!!! HBK!!! HBK!!!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do it, Shawn,&#x201d; Layfield hollers, &#x201c;before it&#x2019;s too late. This is your second chance, but understand this, understand this&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;HBK!!! HBK!!! HBK!!!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2013;Listen to me and not them! If you take this shot . . . then this offer is off the table . . . <i>forever</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>The crowd stops chanting. Different cries are heard: boos, shouts to attack, shouts to stop. There is no longer unity in the auditorium.<br><br>Layfield holds his head outstretched until the Heartbreak Kid slowly turns his back. Layfield leers. Shawn Michaels climbs through the ropes out of the ring and walks heavily back to the dressing room, his dull gaze on the ground.<br><br>&#x201c;Lookin&#x2019; forward to doin&#x2019; business with ya, Shawn,&#x201d; Layfield shouts after him.<br><br>The crowd screams.<br><br>Layfield, like most of the wrestlers, has a long, complicated fictional backstory that includes a host of highly publicized intrigues, fights, betrayals, infidelities, abuse, and outrageous behavior&#x2013;including goose-stepping around the ring and giving the Nazi salute during a wrestling bout in Germany. But tonight he has come in his newest incarnation as the &#x201c;self-made millionaire,&#x201d; the capitalist, the CEO who walked away with a pot of gold while workers across the country lost their jobs, saw their savings and retirement funds evaporate, and fought off foreclosure.<br><br>As often happens in a celebrity culture, the line between public and fictional personas blurs. Layfield actually claims to have made a fortune as a stock market investor and says he is married to the &#x201c;richest woman on Wall Street.&#x201d; He is a regular panelist on Fox News Channel&#x2019;s <i>The Cost of Freedom </i>and previously appeared on CNBC, not only as a celebrity wrestler but as a savvy investor whose conservative political views are worth airing. He also has written a best-selling book on financial planning called <i>Have More Money Now. </i>He hosts a weekend talk-radio program syndicated nationally by Talk Radio Network, in which he discusses politics.<br><br>The interaction between the crowd and Layfield is vintage professional wrestling. The twenty-minute bouts employ the same tired gimmicks, the same choreographed moves, the endless counts to two by the referee that never seem to get to three without the pinned wrestler leaping up from the mat to continue the fight. There is the desperate struggle of a prostrate wrestler trying to reach the hand of his or her partner to be relieved in the ring. This pantomime, with his opponent on his back and his arm outstretched, can go on for a couple of minutes. There are a lot of dirty shots when the referee is distracted&#x2013;which is often.<br><br>The bouts are stylized rituals. They are public expressions of pain and a fervent longing for revenge. The lurid and detailed sagas behind each bout, rather than the wrestling matches themselves, are what drive crowds to a frenzy. These ritualized battles give those packed in the arenas a temporary, heady release from mundane lives. The burden of real problems is transformed into fodder for a high-energy pantomime. And the most potent story tonight, the most potent story across North America, is one of financial ruin, desperation, and enslavement of a frightened and abused working class to a heart...</p><h2>A Gardener&#39;s Alphabet</h2><p>Bringing the wonders of gardening to life, a charming alphabet book details the many refreshing and rejuvenating qualities of gardens and depicts flowers, vegetables, and trees with beautiful woodcuts. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Caldecott Medalist Mary Azarian is a consummate gardener and a skilled and original woodblock artist.

It was the only time these men -- the two greatest captains of their age -- fought against each other. Waterloo, once it was over, put an end to twenty-two years of French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and led to a century of relative peace and progress in Europe.</p><p>When the wars of the future did come, they were fought with infinitely more appalling methods by a constantly changing balance of powers. At Waterloo, the honor of bold, lavish uniforms and, at least initially, the aesthetic beauty of battle were still intact.</p><p>With precision and elegance, <strong>Andrew Roberts</strong> lucidly sets the political, strategic, and historical scene before offering a breathtaking account of each successive stage of the battle.</p><p>He also draws on a recently discovered document from 1854 that casts new light on just how the battle was lost. It is a confession from a French officer that helps to explain why the French cavalry charged when it did -- unsupported by infantry or artillery, and headlong at well-defended British squares. It shows that accident rather than design may have led to the debacle that lost Napoleon the battle, the campaign, and the war.</p><p>Authoritative and engrossing, <strong>Waterloo</strong> is a brilliant portrait of a legendary turning point in modern history, after which the balance of world power, the legend of Napoleon, and the art of war were never the same.</p></p><p><p>Andrew Roberts is the author of <em>Masters and Commanders</em> and <em>A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900.</em> His other books include <em>Napoleon and Wellington, Eminent Churchillians,</em> and <em>Salisbury,</em> which won the Wolfson History Prize. A Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, he holds a PhD in history from Cambridge University and writes regularly for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>The Daily Beast.</em> He lives in New York City.</p>This summary narrative supplies basic data about Waterloo and evaluates mistakes by both Wellington and Napoleon that make the historic battle one of the most worked-over topics for speculation in military history. A <i>Saturday Night Live</i> skit once parodied the phenomenon by wondering, What if Napoleon had a B-52 at the Battle of Waterloo? Roberts' original contribution to historical contingency--for such an exhaustively studied battle, his research, amazingly enough, turned up new evidence--is that a cavalry charge by Marshal Ney, possibly the gravest error the French made during the battle, was a spontaneous assault rather than an intended one. Smoothly integrating the what-ifs into the chronology, Roberts joins the essential facts about Waterloo, such as its area and relief, to the morale of individual units involved. Emphasizing the courage and fear that rippled over the battlefield during its daylong course, Roberts instills an appreciation for Waterloo as a horrific experience saturated with alternative possible outcomes.

The vivid interplay between a war story and a love story, and between the Kremlin and the frontline, grants the novel its momentum. Like so much historical fiction, <em>Red Sky at Noon</em> keeps readers turning pages not to learn the end but to better understand the individuals who brought about this end.

His seventeen novels have won millions of readers around the world, and his sea fiction is required reading in the Literature of the Sea course at the U.S. Naval Academy. <i>The Med</i> is the first in his novel-cycle of the modern Navy, which also includes <i>The Gulf</i>, <i>The Circle</i>, <i>The Passage</i> and<i> Tomahawk</i>. He lives in Virginia with his wife and daughter.<br>In the mold of such novels as From Here to Eternity and the recent Time and Tide, this is a powerful story, as honest as it is imaginative, about a joint Navy-Marine task force on a mission to rescue a large group of American and British hostages being held in Syria by Palestinian terrorists. The plot revolves around a few key characters, each in the grip of crises both personal and relevant to the fate of the mission. Among the well-delineated principals are the force commander, a jittery, careerist commodore unworthy of his rank; a naval lieutenant trying to live down a tragic past mistake; a chief engineer who figures in a wonderfully vivid engine-room drama; a sensitive, guitar-playing black who feels out of place in the Marines; the lieutenant's wife, who is among the hostages; and the terrorist leader, ruthless yet with a certain charisma. The commodore's inadequacies jeopardize the Marine assault that is the story's exciting climax. Readers will be gripped by the impression that these are real men in a realistic, and indeed uncomfortably topical, situation.

It's a shock to wake up to the end of the 20th instead, and to the end of a deeply satisfying book. Lionel Lambourne, who was head of paintings at London's Victoria and Albert Museum for nearly a decade, writes with knowledge, wit, and grace. "Scratch a cynic and you will always find a sentimentalist," he says with regard to Victorian genre painting. In discussing the nude and a return to classicism, he writes, "Such works ... provided an additional thrill for their <i>nouveau riche</i> owners, for by displaying them they could show evidence of classical leanings, if not a classical education."<p> After an excellent introductory overview, Lambourne divides his course into 21 chapters, including: "The Victorian Art Establishment," "The Fresco Revival," "The Panorama," "Childhood and Sentiment," "Fairy Painting," "Sporting and Animal Painting," "The Pre-Raphaelites," "The Frailer Sex and Fallen Woman," "Aesthetes and Symbolists," and "Impressionism in Britain." The editing and design of the book are superb, with reproductions exactly matching the text and captions containing all relevant information. Lambourne offers new dimensions even to history we think we know well, such as Whistler's lawsuit against the critic John Ruskin, who famously accused the artist of "flinging a pot of paint in the public's face." In Lambourne's view, the controversy "marked the beginning of aspects of art as various as conceptualism and abstraction," and he goes on to explain why. A tour de force of scholarship served up with style, <i>Victorian Painting</i> does ample justice to a complex, frequently misunderstood era. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>This text presents an overview of one of the most fertile and exuberant periods in the history of art. It embraces not only the UK but also the English-speaking countries linked to England by the cultural ties of empire and emigration.

The Normans set up castles to control the native population, and four-fifths of all England&#39;s land changed ownership.

Moore (Psychology and Religion/Chicago Theological Seminary) and Gillette (a pastoral counselor) write about ``the king within''--a psychological potential that each man apparently carries--with authority and total conviction, discussing the four Jungian archetypes (``King,'' ``Warrior,'' ``Magician,'' ``Lover''), recalling their many representations in ancient and modern cultures, and examining associated patterns of energy that empower men. Readers expecting descriptions of sweat lodges and exotic rites of passage won't find them here. The authors focus on myth and ritual as psychological skills in the quest for the king within, a mature man who strives to achieve creativity and make a positive difference in the world. Although Moore and Gillette acknowledge a variety of failed specimens, from weaklings like-- they say--King Arthur and Jimmy Carter to ``Shadow Kings'' like Caligula and wayward CEOs, they concentrate on identifying positive qualities (caring, courage), on learning how to tap into them, and on empowering others to do the same. To the authors, the urge for power is no shame as long as it's channeled justly. Regrettably, Moore and Gillette rarely refer to contemporary situations and rely on alienating jargon: ``Since the fully manifested King experiences a passionate union with the Anima...Queen, a man can experience the deep Self approaching the Jungian exemplum, but his Self is likely to be asymmetrically masculine.'' For a more accessible, reality-oriented view of similar territory, try Samuel Osherson's Wrestling with Love, reviewed below. (But those attuned to the authors' approach should note that a follow-up title, The Warrior Within, is due out in August.) (Eight pages of color photos; 50 b&amp;w photos--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The archetypal image of the liberating, life-giving King lurks within every man's psyche, according to Jungian psychoanalyst Moore and pastoral counselor Gillette, coauthors of King, Warrior, Magician, Lover. Here they bid readers to "access and utilize our King energy," warning that men who repress the inner King suffer from aimlessness and depression and may even be possessed by the King's bipolar Shadow, which turns the male ego into either a Tyrant or a Weakling. Their ideal Generative Man "may be communist or capitalist, industrialist or peasant. He may be an animal-rights advocate or a whale hunter, and is as much a poet as a soldier." The writing is not always this vague and silly, but only men's movement enthusiasts are apt to follow the authors' arduous prescriptions for dream analysis, prayer, "active imagination," Ego-archetype dialogue, and meditation on pyramids or images of Egyptian pharaohs, Assyrian kings, swords and suits of armor. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Walter the Farting Dog: Banned From the Beach</h2><p>Mr. and Mrs. Crabbe are enjoying their seaside vacation . . . until a certain dog blows away their umbrella with an enormous fart.

An award-winning fine artist, he became a disciple of the saint, Swami Rama in 1969. Internationally known in the fields of leadership and holistic personal development, Bates is an Ericksonian hypnotherapist, a member of the organizational faculty of the Gestalt Institute of Cleveland, a member of the National Training Laboratories (NTL), and member of the board of directors of the national Yoga Alliance. He has taught at the University of Minnesota Bush Foundation for Superintendents and Principals Leadership, and created programs in the integration of yoga and modern therapy, executive leadership, and contemporary systems thinking, helping leaders across the country and Canada into new systems thinking and personal development. In 1999 he established 10th Dot Transformations, carrying the treasures of yoga philosophy to corporate America. He has authored an award-winning book, Pigs Eat Wolves: Going into Partnership with Your Dark Side, as well as Ransoming the Mind: Yoga and Modern Therapy.Bates ( Ransoming the Mind ) reminds readers of the importance of fairy tales as ``the metaphors and poetry of the human psyche.'' Specifically, he contends that in the story of ``The Three Little Pigs'' (the unexpurgated tale, not the sanitized, truncated version familiar to most readers) lies a powerful paradigm for inner transformation. Snippets of the tale are laboriously exegeted by the author. Bates's analysis, however, crosses the line into eisegesisreading into the text as he reads far more into the story than the text warrants, while vague anecdotes are left standing as if self-explanatory. He blends equal portions of pop psychology, Eastern philosophy and Jungian archetypes to claim that the wicked wolf is a projection of our shadow self, which must be engaged if we are to achieve personal integration. By going into partnership with the wolves of our lives, claims the author, we can grasp the divinity that is rightly ours. Bates's exposition cautions readers to recall that one should never treat evil as if it arises wholly outside oneself, a point better made by St. Augustine 1600 years ago. The very brief afterword by Bly ( Iron John ) adds little. <p></p><p>Copyright 1991 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Exodus II: Let My People Go</h2><p>This non-fiction book was written in 1983.

His opponents thought his decision unwise at best, and ruinous at worst. But they could not have been more wrong.<br><br>With <i>The Money Makers</i>, Eric Rauchway tells the absorbing story of how FDR and his advisors pulled the levers of monetary policy to save the domestic economy and propel the United States to unprecedented prosperity and superpower status. Drawing on the ideas of the brilliant British economist John Maynard Keynes, among others, Roosevelt created the conditions for recovery from the Great Depression, deploying economic policy to fight the biggest threat then facing the nation: deflation.<br><br>Throughout the 1930s, he also had one eye on the increasingly dire situation in Europe. In order to defeat Hitler, Roosevelt turned again to monetary policy, sending dollars abroad to prop up the faltering economies of Britain and, beginning in 1941, the Soviet Union. FDR's fight against economic depression and his fight against fascism were indistinguishable. As Rauchway writes, "Roosevelt wanted to ensure more than business recovery; he wanted to restore American economic and moral strength so the US could defend civilization itself." The economic and military alliance he created proved unbeatable-and also provided the foundation for decades of postwar prosperity. Indeed, Rauchway argues that Roosevelt's greatest legacy was his monetary policy. Even today, the "Roosevelt dollar" remains both the symbol and the catalyst of America's vast economic power.<br><br><i>The Money Makers</i> restores the Roosevelt dollar to its central place in our understanding of FDR, the New Deal, and the economic history of twentieth-century America. We forget this history at our own peril. In revealing the roots of our postwar prosperity, Rauchway shows how we can recapture the abundance of that period in our own.<br></p><p><b>Eric Rauchway</b> is a historian at the University of California, Davis, and the author of numerous books on the Progressive and New Deal eras.

Philosophers think; politicians maneuver. Jefferson&#x2019;s genius was that he was both and could do both, often simultaneously. Such is the art of power.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thomas Jefferson hated confrontation, and yet his understanding of power and of human nature enabled him to move men and to marshal ideas, to learn from his mistakes, and to prevail. Passionate about many things&#x2014;women, his family, books, science, architecture, gardens, friends, Monticello, and Paris&#x2014;Jefferson loved America most, and he strove over and over again, despite fierce opposition, to realize his vision: the creation, survival, and success of popular government in America. Jon Meacham lets us see Jefferson&#x2019;s world as Jefferson himself saw it, and to appreciate how Jefferson found the means to endure and win in the face of rife partisan division, economic uncertainty, and external threat. Drawing on archives in the United States, England, and France, as well as unpublished Jefferson presidential papers, Meacham presents Jefferson as the most successful political leader of the early republic, and perhaps in all of American history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The father of the ideal of individual liberty, of the Louisiana Purchase, of the Lewis and Clark expedition, and of the settling of the West, Jefferson recognized that the genius of humanity&#x2014;and the genius of the new nation&#x2014;lay in the possibility of progress, of discovering the undiscovered and seeking the unknown. From the writing of the Declaration of Independence to elegant dinners in Paris and in the President&#x2019;s House; from political maneuverings in the boardinghouses and legislative halls of Philadelphia and New York to the infant capital on the Potomac; from his complicated life at Monticello, his breathtaking house and plantation in Virginia, to the creation of the University of Virginia, Jefferson was central to the age. Here too is the personal Jefferson, a man of appetite, sensuality, and passion.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Jefferson story resonates today not least because he led his nation through ferocious partisanship and cultural warfare amid economic change and external threats, and also because he embodies an eternal drama, the struggle of the leadership of a nation to achieve greatness in a difficult and confounding world.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;This is probably the best single-volume biography of Jefferson ever written.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Gordon S.

It&#x2019;s no mean feat to render the life and times of such a figure (much less make it compulsively readable), but as with his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Andrew Jackson (<i>American Lion</i>), Jon Meacham&#x2019;s <i>Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power</i> vividly illustrates the world and impact of our third president, deftly weaving the threads of Jefferson&#x2019;s personality into a complete portrait of a singularly complex politician and thinker--a philosopher president. --<i>Jon Foro</i><b>Jon Meacham</b> is the author, most recently, of <i>Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power, </i>a #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller that has been named one of the best books of the year by <i>The New York Times Book Review,</i> <i>The Washington Post,</i> <i>Entertainment Weekly,</i> <i>The Seattle Times, </i>and the <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>.

Average-quality full- color illustrations depict the flora and fauna that thrive in this harsh environment, but no distinction is made between the plants and animals found in the American West and those of the other desert areas. This may cause a great deal of confusion. The author makes mention of some of the natural resources that have been found "under desert floors," but again doesn't cite specific locations. The lifestyle of desert people is touched upon, but there is no indication as to which continents these nomads might roam.

She thinks she sees through everyone and rules over a family of dependents with knowing cynicism. But there are two people in Redborough who resist her. One is Hester, a young relation with a personality as strong as Catherine's, and as determined to find a role for herself. The other is Edward, who Catherine treats like a son. Conflict between the young and the old is inevitable, and in its depiction of the complex relationships that develop between the three principal characters, <em>Hester</em> is a masterpiece of psychological realism. In exploring the difficulty of understanding human nature, it is also a compulsive story of financial and sexual risk-taking that inevitably results in a searing climax.

During these times of renewal and prayer, we talk over the events of our lives and share burdens we have for ourselves and others. Very often, we realize that the Great Shepherd has once again reached out and carried us through the day as we spend these introspective moments together.<p>If the pleasure of sharing these thoughts anew has taught us anything, it is this: that God&#x2019;s Word is true. Our Heavenly Father is faithful and will never leave us or forsake us. As we come to Him daily, willing to be shaped and directed, His Word gives guideposts of clear direction. Almost everything we read, see, and experience shows us in some way that, although we do not visibly see God, He is with us. Over centuries of time others have looked back to understand that God&#x2019;s Spirit and presence were there, even when they felt alone.</p><p>In our quiet moments of reflection, in the fellowship of others, and even in dreams, God opens the doors to our hearts. This is what happened when I originally wrote the poem, "Footprints". After hours of wrestling with the darkness of doubt and despair, I finally surrendered to Him and, in the early morning light of peace, wrote the poem as result of that spiritual experience.</p><p>Listen for the gentle stirring of God&#x2019;s grace in your own mind and soul as you read these verses of encouragement. Each of us is different in our spiritual need, just as each of our days is different. God wants to place His signature on your life in a unique way. As you spend time, even just a few moments each day, reflecting on His Word, it will help you to know Him better. Spiritual growth is not so much what we have done, but the feeling of love for Him we put into everything we do. It is not so much in knowing about God that we grow, but in getting to know Him in a personal, relational way. It is in becoming "a friend of God" as Abraham did that we grow in His grace, talking with Him as our companion along the way. Letting God sift our thoughts and plans through the standards of His Word. May these verses encourage you anew each day as you walk with Him. God Is With Us ... In Our Dreams One night I dreamed a dream. Some of our dreams can have a powerful effect on us. All of us have, at one time or another, awakened laughing or fretful&#x2014;and all because of a dream. The Bible tells us about many people who had dreams and visions that were given to them by God ...</p><p>[Jacob] had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. &#x2014;Genesis 28:12</p><p>Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. &#x2014;Genesis 37:5</p><p>At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon during the night in a dream, and God said, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you." &#x2014;1 Kings 3:5</p><p>An angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him." &#x2014;Matthew 2:13</p><p>After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child&#x2019;s life are dead." &#x2014;Matthew 2:19&#x2013;20</p><p>One day at about three in the afternoon [Cornelius] had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, "Cornelius!" &#x2014;Acts 10:3</p><p>During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us." &#x2014;Acts 16:9 Some of our dreams are disappointing, but these are "wishful thinking" dreams, things we come up with in our own minds, circumstances or situations that we wish would happen. Only a small portion of these kind of dreams ever come true. In fact, these dreams can be harmful if we allow them to fill us with false hope ...</p><p>This is what the LORD Almighty says: "Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you; they fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD. &#x2014;Jeremiah 23:16 Yet we should not ignore our dreams. God will sometimes use our dreams to assure us of his promises or to tell us something about himself. And when God does speak to us in dreams, he will also help us understand them ...</p><p>[God] said, "Listen to my words: "When a prophet of the LORD is among you, I reveal myself to him in visions, I speak to him in dreams." &#x2014;Numbers 12:6</p><p>I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions. &#x2014;Joel 2:28 Jesus left his disciples with a great promise that is true for us today: "Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age" (Matthew 28:20).</p><p>God&#x2019;s presence with us is a reality. Acts 2:17 also tells us that God will pour his "Spirit on all people." As we dream our dreams with the knowledge that God is with us, we will begin to see things as Christ does and dream dreams inspired by the Holy Spirit that are worth re-telling and following.</p></p><h2>Lancelot: The Betrayal</h2><p>Set in a 5th century post-Roman Britain besieged by invading war bands of Saxons and Franks, Irish and Picts, Giles Kristian's epic new novel will tell - through the warrior's own words - the story of Lancelot, the most celebrated of all King Arthur's knights. And it's a story that&#x2019;s ready to be re-imagined for our times.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a story imbued with the magic and superstition that was such an integral part of the enchanted landscape of Britain during this dark times. Many of the familiar names from Arthurian mythology will be here - Mordred and Gawain, Morgana and, of course, Merlin -as will be those vital icons of the legend such as the Round Table and the sword in the stone but these will be reinvented, reforged for a new generation of readers.<br><br>Lancelot: The Betrayal is a story of warriors and kings, of strife, warfare and bloodshed but it is also a story of friendship, of over-arching ambition, of betrayal, of love and lust, guilt and tragedy.</p><p>Family history (he is half Norwegian) inspired GILES KRISTIAN to write his first historical novels: the acclaimed and bestselling Raven Viking trilogy &#x2013; Blood Eye, Sons of Thunder and Odin's Wolves. A long-held fascination with the English Civil War then led him to chartt the fortunes of a family divided by that brutal conflict in The Bleeding Land and Brothers&#x2019; Fury before co-writing Wilbur Smith&#x2019;s No.1 bestseller, Golden Lion. He returned to the world of the Vikings with the acclaimed God of Vengeance (a Times Book of the Year), Winter&#x2019;s Fire and Wings of the Storm. Giles lives in Leicestershire.&#34;It is a masterpiece in the true sense of the word.&#34; -- CONN IGGULDEN, author of The Falcon of Sparta &#34;Some of us grew up with T H White&#39;s Once and Future King as our touchstone for authenticity in the Arthurian myths; others found that Rosemary Sutcliff, Bernard Cornwell or Mary Stewart filled that role. Giles Kristian pulls together the best of the best and infuses it with his own utterly transformative understanding of myth, magic - and the many faces of love . . . There are so many modern retellings of the Arthurian myth, but this one stands head and shoulders above the rest, in the company of true greatness.&#34; -- MANDA SCOTT, author of Boudica &#34;Without doubt this is Giles Kristian&#39;s finest novel to date. Glorious. Tragic. Lyrical. Totally gripping. I loved it.&#34; -- BEN KANE, author of Clash of Empires &#34;I loved the post Roman chaos of Giles&#39; vision, just as I imagine it would have been but with the life of that vision breathed into it to render it in stark and bloody tones. But what I enjoyed most was the sheer glorious brutality of the age, delivered by a writer with the heart of a warrior and the soul of a poet. It&#39;s really, really good.&#34; -- ANTHONY RICHES, author of The Centurions series &#34;His Lancelot is no airy tale of magic and romance, but a muscular telling of warriors and survival, beautifully rendered in a prose that is both visceral and lyrical. This is historical fiction at its very best.&#34; -- ELIZABETH FREMANTLE, author of The Girl in the Glass Tower &#34;Authentic, epic, and wonderfully Arthurian.&#34; -- CHRISTIAN CAMERON, author of The Ill-Made Knight &#34;Giles Kristian&#39;s brilliant take on the Arthurian love-triangle is impressively fresh and original . . . the language is arrestingly beautiful, poetic and poignant; the fights are satisfyingly bloody; the background is a believably muddy, pagan and benighted post-Roman Britain, against which Giles unfolds a tender and tragic love story. We know it will end badly, but reading this enchanting and elegiac novel, you can&#39;t help rooting for Lancelot and his love and hoping it will all work out somehow by the final page.&#34; -- ANGUS DONALD, author of Outlaw &#34;I was awaiting Lancelot with great anticipation. This most fascinating character from Arthurian legend has been plucked from the 14th-century romances and positioned firmly back in the early medieval environment he belongs in. Giles is an extraordinary writer, able to capture sounds, smells, sensations in a sentence. No other writer thinks and feels his way back to the medieval past the way he does. There is such drama and dynamism in this text that it&#39;s impossible to put down. Lancelot is an exceptional book and does what only great historical fiction can do: transport you back through time to feast, fight and feel alongside fascinating characters from the past. No one does this better than Giles Kristian.&#34; -- DR JANINA RAMIREZ</p><h2>Do Unto Others (Freehold Series)</h2><p>Science fiction high adventure with a compulsive thriller edge.&nbsp; The inheritor of a family planetary mining dynasty defends her family and the fortune they carved from a wasteland against lawless invaders who would take everything they&#x2019;ve worked for in a nasty attack.<br><br>The Prescott family carved a mining fortune out of uninhabitable waste.&nbsp; In the process, they became some of the richest people in the known galaxy &#x2013; and human targets.&nbsp; Now the next generation of Prescotts fights for its life against powerful and lawless invaders who would steal the fortune that it has taken a family years, blood, sweat and tears to build.&nbsp; <br><br>Caron Prescott, the tough-as-nails inheritor of the Prescott dynasty, has the spirit to put up a fight, but until now she has gone untested.&nbsp; That all changes as Carron is stranded on a lonely mining outpost world.&nbsp; Now she must prove her mettle as an army of hired goons descends &#x2013; and, in the process, keep her miners from accidentally blowing the whole planet up when they rally to the Prescott cause! <br><br><b>About Michael Z.

That was 14 years ago, and in the course of preparing this massive study of Greene (still very much alive at 84), Sherry trod in the novelist's wide-ranging footsteps too. He also was given access to Greene's remarkable letters, granted occasional, highly reluctant interviews by his reclusive subject, and even managed to unearth Britons who knew him at school. The portrait that results is riveting, going to the heart of Greene's darkly anguished worldview and the anxieties, guilts and demons that have driven him to create more than 30 novels, travel books and essay collections. From the start, as a pupil at a school where his father was headmaster, Greene was unhappily out of place, aware in the bullying of his schoolfellows of the omnipresence of evil. He suffered agonizingly from boredom and as an Oxford student went on harebrained cloak-and-dagger trips to Germany and Ireland in search of danger; in extremity, he played Russian roulette with a loaded revolver. Some of this has been recounted in Greene's own eliptical memoirs, A Sort of Life and Ways of Escape , but Sherry expands on them convincingly, showing what the novelist evaded or omitted. Entirely new, too, are the details of Greene's romantically obsessive courtship of Vivien, the wife for whose sake he embraced Roman Catholicism. Sherry is as good on the literary side as on the personal. Greene's books are exhaustively mined for sources--Sherry's travels yield remarkable discoveries, including the identities of some of the people who were fashioned into characters in Brighton Rock and The Power and the Glory --and judiciously evaluated. Greene's early journalism, his fascination with the movies and his years as a reviewer also make absorbing chapters. Biography on this scale, and of this quality, is rare and justifies its length. The second volume is eagerly awaited. Photos not seen by PW . <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc."The journeys Greene made, I made," boasts Sherry. Besides tracking chronic traveler Greene, Sherry utilizes Greene's journals and correspondence as well as interviews with his friends and his estranged wife, Vivien. The picture that emerges is one of an atheist who converted to Catholicism for passion's sake, a painfully sensitive youth who transformed himself into "one of the finest novelists of his generation." This first of a projected two-volume biography concludes with the composition of Greene's masterpiece, The Power and the Glory . Few living authors have received the attention Sherry lavishes on Greene, and few have deserved it more.

While these vehicles are usually presented as a historical development, they are here equated with the attitudes that individuals bring to their Buddhist practice. Basic to them all, however, is the need to understand our own immediate condition. The primary tool for achieving this is meditation, and <i>The Essence of Buddhism </i> serves as a handbook for the various meditative approaches of Buddhist practice. <br><br>Beginning with the Four Noble Truths, Traleg Rinpoche incorporates the expansive vision of the bodhisattva path and the transformative vision of Tantra. The final chapters present the transcendent view of Mahamudra. This view dispenses with all dualistic fixations and directly realizes the natural freedom of the mind itself. <br><br>Along the way, the author provides vivid definitions of fundamental concepts such as compassion, emptiness, and Buddha-nature, and answers common questions: Why does Buddhism teach that there is "no self"? Are Buddhist teachings pessimistic? Does Buddhism encourage social passivity? What is the role of sex in Buddhist Tantra? Why is it said that "samsara is nirvana"? Does it take countless lifetimes to attain enlightenment, or can it be achieved in a moment?</p><p>Traleg Kyabgon (1955&#x2013;2012) was born in Eastern Tibet and educated by many great masters of all four major lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. He is the founder of the Kagyu E-Vam Buddhist Institute, which is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, with a major practice center in upstate New York and a practice community in New York City. He taught extensively at universities and Buddhist centers in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia beginning in 1980, and is the author of numerous books that present Buddhist teachings to Western readers, including <i>The Essence of Buddhism</i> and <i>Mind at Ease</i>.</p><h2>The Artemis Fowl #2: Arctic Incident Graphic Novel</h2><p>Since the release of <i>Artemis Fowl</i> in 2001, Eoin Colfer&#x2019;s blockbuster series has sold more than eight million copies in the United States alone. Now, in this second graphic novel installment of the series, fans can follow along as the world&#x2019;s youngest criminal mastermind rushes to save a man who has been kidnapped by the Russian Mafiya: his own father.<br><br>Eoin Colfer has once again teamed up with acclaimed comic writer Andrew Donkin to adapt the text for this action-packed, brilliantly illustrated adventure in the Artemis Fowl series.<br><br></p><p>Eoin Colfer's bestselling antihero is back in <i>Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident</i>--the superb sequel to the hyper-hyped <i>Artemis Fowl</i>, shortlisted for the Whitbread Children's Book of the Year. <i>The Arctic Incident</i> sees the slightly older, perhaps slightly more mellow arch-criminal Artemis recovered from his last adventure, richer now that he has his half of a hoard of fairy gold, and happier since the Clarice Starlingesque superfairy Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon returned his mother's ailing mind to full health. <p> But there is still much unfinished business: Artemis Fowl Sr. disappeared when a daring escapade designed to free his family from their criminal--not to mention deeply lucrative--past and move the family's assets into legitimate enterprises went horribly wrong. Held captive by the Mafiya (the Russian organized crime syndicate) for over two years, he has been declared officially dead, but Artemis Jr. knows in his heart (yes, he does have one) that his beloved father is still alive, and he is determined to find him. Meanwhile Captain Short is temporarily on assignment to Customs and Excise as punishment for letting Fowl separate her and her People from their gold and is finding her stakeout duties a little dull. It soon becomes obvious that the pair have need of each other's considerable skills, and before long they are on track for an adventure that will ultimately have far-reaching consequences for both of them.</p> <p> If you enjoyed the first book, you won't be disappointed by the second. Initially the pace is a little slower, and the slightly more mellow Artemis is certainly a tad unnerving at first (particularly as one of the things that made him such an unusual character was the fact that there was something distinctly unlikable about him), but once the sparks between Holly and Artemis begin to fly, and the adventure that tests their endurance to their emotional, physical, and intellectual limits begins, the pages just keep on turning.</p> <p> The high-tech hocus pocus, the complex underworld, and the James Bond-style storyline will keep even the most reluctant reader enthralled. Add to the mix a fair dollop of humor, the occasional sprinkling of right-on commentary about the state of the planet, and enough hooks in the story to ensure you will be clamoring for the next book. This chilling, thrilling adventure is a seriously cool (in more ways than one!) must-read for anyone age 9 and older. <i>--Susan Harrison</i></p>Eoin Colfer is the<em>New York Times</em>best-selling author of the Artemis Fowl series,<em>Airman</em>,<em>Half Moon Investigations,</em><em>The Supernaturalist,</em><em>Eoin Colfer's Legend of...</em>books,<em>The Wish List,</em><em>Benny and Omar</em>; and<em>Benny and Babe</em>.

Take the pilcrow: present at the birth of punctuation, its story encompasses the ancient Greeks, Charlemagne, medieval writing, England&#39;s greatest twentieth-century typographer and several brushes with extinction before its most recent revival in word-processing software.

In 1968, McLain set the baseball world on fire by being the first pitcher to win at least 30 games since Dizzy Dean 34 years earlier. But just two years later he was banned from the game for half a season, traded away to the laughing-stock Washington Senators where he entered into a never-ending battle with baseball icon Ted Williams. By 1972, he was a retired star, hustling games of golf. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he was in and out of prison for charges including racketeering, loan-sharking, extortion, cocaine possession, and fraud before being included in wide-sweeping RICO charges that tried to connect him to Gotti and the violent underworld of the mafia. In this moving autobiography, McLain reveals how his desire for excitement and attention led directly to his downfall from being a popular public image and cost him his marriage, which has since been reconciled and remarried.</p><p>"Denny McLain, Denny McLain, <br>There's never been any <br>Like Denny McLain." <br>--from a song written by late Tigers broadcaster Ernie HarwellIn 1968, 24-year-old Denny McLain turned the baseball world upside down by winning 31 games for the Detroit Tigers. After he won both the MVP and Cy Young Awards in '68, McLain showed that his talents weren't limited to the baseball diamond when he cut two albums for Capital Records and played the Hammond Organ in a three-week stint at Las Vegas's Riviera Hotel. <p>In 1969 at age 25, he became the youngest pitcher to win 100 games. But winning games and performing on stage were never enough. McLain was driven by an insatiable thirst for attention and adventure. In 1969, flying his airplane back from a dental appointment in Detroit that he could have rescheduled, Denny arrived 20 minutes after he was supposed to throw the first pitch of the 1969 All-Star Game in Washington D.C. In 1970 his picture appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated next to the headline, "Denny McLain and the Mob, Baseball's Big Scandal." Commissioner Bowie Kuhn suspended him for half the 1970 season for having consorted with gamblers as a 21-year-old back in 1967. </p><p>By 1972 the pain and inflammation of a torn rotator cuff in his pitching shoulder became overwhelming, and at age 28, Denny McLain was washed up as a major league pitcher. It was then that McLain's bravado and notion of invincibility led him squarely into the jaws of disaster. In 1985 he was convicted of racketeering, loan-sharking, and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. His decision not to testify against the mafia led to a 23-year sentence. </p><p>McLain won a reversal 29 months later, and by the late 1980s he had become a star again as a radio talk-show host and TV personality in Detroit. That didn't last. In 1992 his world was shattered by the death of his 26-year-old, firstborn daughter, Kristin, in a horrific car accident. The loss sent McLain into a desperate state and awakened his self-destructive demons. </p><p>In 1996 Denny was convicted of stealing $2.5 million from the pension fund of a failing meat-packing company he'd foolishly purchased. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. In I Told You I Wasn't Perfect, McLain colorfully recounts the elements of his fabulous success in one of baseball's most exciting eras and of his downward spiral--ending with where he is today, starting over once again.</p></p><h2>Love You More</h2><p>Book Description Who do you love?

Or maybe a professor of Russian history. Instead he became a bestselling thriller writer, and winner of the International Thriller Writers Award for Best Novel for</em> Killer Instinct<em> and winner of the Barry and Gumshoe Awards for Best Thriller for </em>Company Man.<p></p> <p>I just took a break from writing my new book to read the latest by Lisa Gardner, who's one of the very few writers on my must-read list. Usually, when I'm deep into a novel, I read very little in the genre. But Lisa Gardner sent me an advance copy of <em>Love You More</em>, and I pretty much dropped everything and read it through the weekend.</p> <p>I've been a fan of Lisa's D.D. Warren series for some time, but she's truly outdone herself with this one. It grabs you on the first page and keeps you guessing until the final chapter, moving effortlessly between first person and third person narration, weaving an extraordinary amount of research into nonstop action.</p> <p><em>Love You More</em> starts with a crime we think we understand. Massachusetts State Trooper Tessa Leoni's husband Brian is dead in their kitchen, and Trooper Leoni has been beaten almost to death. It looks to everyone like a case of a battered wife defending herself at last. But Leoni's six-year-old daughter, Sophie, is missing, and the trooper's story is full of holes--holes that become even wider and more curious as Boston Police Detective Sergeant D.D. Warren and her old lover, friend and former partner Bobby Dodge investigate.</p> <p>Warren is dealing with issues of her own, as her relationship with Alex (who never appears in person in this installment) reaches a major turning point, one with implications for Warren's investigation and beyond. (I'm not going to give away what that is. You'll have to read it to find out for yourself.) The nature and power of Trooper Leoni's attachment to her daughter are central to this story: just how much does Leoni love her daughter, and to what lengths will she go to protect her? Is it possible that a mother so devoted could kill her own child?</p> <p>As Warren and Dodge follow the trail of clues, they uncover secrets at every turn: a terrible crime in Leoni's adolescence, a shameful secret of her husband's, and unimaginable betrayal among comrades and friends. Stakes escalate to a climax that is shocking, sad and deeply satisfying.</p> <p><em>Love You More</em> stands out in the crowded field of thrillers not only because it's a terrific book, but because it features two compelling and believable female protagonists. Trooper Leoni tells us her own story in the first person, alternating with the third-person narrative of Warren's investigation. Leoni's motives emerge over the course of the book, but her passion and conviction draw us in even before we know whether she's guilty or innocent. We cannot argue with her absolute drive, even as we root for Warren and Dodge to make sure justice is done. It's a remarkable juggling act that requires rare talent, and readers will be anxious for the next installment in D.D. Warren's adventures.</p> <p>I've noticed that a lot of guys have some kind of prejudice against thrillers written by women. Take my word for it: Lisa Gardner has the suspense chops to compete with Harlan Coben, Lee Child, and Michael Connelly. Anyone who's already read Tess Gerritsen, Karin Slaughter, Sandra Brown, or Mary Higgins Clark knows that some of the most gripping thrillers around are written by women.</p> <p>If you haven't yet discovered Lisa Gardner, now's the perfect time to start. <em>Love You More</em> is going to win her a legion of new fans and launch her right to the top of the lists along with Nora Roberts and Tami Hoag--and Stieg Larsson.</p> <p><strong>A Letter from Author Lisa Gardner</strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> True confession time: for a woman who makes her living writing extremely diabolical suspense novels, I have no stomach for gore. Scary movies? Can&#x2019;t watch them. Most of the crime shows on prime time? Egads, no way! Haunted houses? My husband has had to carry me out. It&#x2019;s embarrassing but true.<p></p> <p>So when I first received the invitation to conduct research at the famed Body Farm at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, I didn&#x2019;t know what to do with myself. As a forensics aficionado and thriller author, I just had to visit. A chance to learn first-hand how to search for buried remains? Or how to establish time of death for skeletal remains? Or the amount of forensic evidence that can still be retrieved from cremated bones? Sign me up!</p> <p>On the other hand, this would involve walking the fabled Death&#x2019;s Acre, which generally features several hundred decomposing bodies. I had to consider not just what I was going to see, but what I was going to smell, touch, feel. The squeamish mom in me worried I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to take it. And no one wants to be the one who barfs in front of trained professionals.</p> <p>What&#x2019;s a girl gonna do? Of course I went.</p> <p>The Anthropological Research Facility, aka the Body Farm, was founded in the early &#x2018;80s by Dr. William Bass. Up until then, the discovery of decomposed remains often led to a time of death plus or minus several years. Obviously, this complicated the homicide investigation. Dr. Bass&#x2019;s solution: bury a body, see how long it took to skelatonize, and scientifically establish a rate of decomp.</p> <p>Of course, many variables immediately came into play: buried or unburied, clothed or clothed, hot humid conditions, cold frosty conditions, animal activity, insect activity, etc., etc. In the end, Dr. Bass couldn&#x2019;t bury one body, he needed hundreds. Some donations were unclaimed remains from the ME&#x2019;s office. Hundreds of others are directed donations from people who wanted to contribute to the advancement of science after their death.</p> <p>This kind of generosity makes Death&#x2019;s Acre less a macabre wooded plot and more like hallowed ground. Instead of listening to anthropologists merely analyze body parts, I heard stories of people and families, of victims and criminal prosecutions, of crafty murderers and even craftier forensics experts. I learned of stories told in bone.</p> <p>Interestingly enough, the more the head anthropologist Dr. Lee Jantz humanized the remains we studied, the more bearable I found the sights and smells to be. When I cradled the feather-light cranial plate of a newborn infant in my hand, I could both marvel as its rose petal size and feel the weight of one parent&#x2019;s heart-breaking contribution. I was both mesmerized by the skeleton collection, which took up endless rows of metal shelves, and amazed by how a scientist such as Dr. Jantz could pick up a single piece of cremated bone and tell you the person&#x2019;s gender, approximate age, chronic health conditions and probable occupation.</p> <p>Bones, I learned, aren&#x2019;t just body parts, but an organic record of who we are, what we did, where we lived, and often, how we died. And in the right hands, bones allow the dead to speak. Think a murderer can cover his tracks with a burn barrel and lighter fluid? Think again. Think you can thwart time of death by freezing remains? Nope. Think you can get away with murder? Thanks to forensic anthropologists such as Dr. Jantz, not likely.</p> <p>I came to the Body Farm expecting to be immersed in death, and instead, found a new appreciation for life. And while my family still refuses to let me tell stories about my research over dinner, I had a great time working with the anthropologists on my March 2011 release Love You More. Just remember, when you come to the key scene in the snowy woods&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll know which one I&#x2019;m talking about&#x2014;I worked for that scene.</p> <p>I walked Death&#x2019;s Acre, and I never threw up.</p> <p></p>Lisa Gardner is a New York Times and Sunday Times bestselling author.

The National Theatre production in April 1967 made Tom Stoppard&#39;s reputation virtually overnight. Its wit, stagecraft and verbal verve remain as exhilarating as they were then and the play has become a contemporary classic. &#34;One of the most original and engaging of post-war plays&#34;.

Today there exists an amazing diversity of fossil humans, suggesting we walked upright long before we acquired large brains, and new evidence from molecules that enable scientists to decipher the tree of life as never before.<br><br>The fossil record is now one of the strongest lines of evidence for evolution. In this engaging and richly illustrated book, Donald R. Prothero weaves an entertaining though intellectually rigorous history out of the transitional forms and series that dot the fossil record. Beginning with a brief discussion of the nature of science and the "monkey business of creationism," Prothero tackles subjects ranging from flood geology and rock dating to neo-Darwinism and macroevolution. He covers the ingredients of the primordial soup, the effects of communal living, invertebrate transitions, the development of the backbone, the reign of the dinosaurs, the mammalian explosion, and the leap from chimpanzee to human. Prothero pays particular attention to the recent discovery of "missing links" that complete the fossil timeline and details the debate between biologists over the mechanisms driving the evolutionary process.<br><br><i>Evolution</i> is an absorbing combination of firsthand observation, scientific discovery, and trenchant analysis. With the teaching of evolution still an issue, there couldn't be a better moment for a book clarifying the nature and value of fossil evidence. Widely recognized as a leading expert in his field, Prothero demonstrates that the transformation of life on this planet is far more awe inspiring than the narrow view of extremists.</p><p><p>2007 PSP Award for Excellence in Earth Sciences, Association of American Publishers</p>Donald R.

One falls prey to a series of pranks en route to a legal vocation, while the other studies medicine before discovering a different calling entirely, and it is years before their destinies are entwined in a mesmerizing alliance. We follow each through outrageous accusation and unrivaled success, through faith and perseverance and dogged self-recrimination, whether in the dock awaiting complete disgrace or at the height of fame while desperately in love with a woman not his wife, and gradually realize that George is half-Indian and that Arthur becomes the creator of the world&#x2019;s most famous detective. Ranging from London clubs to teeming prisons, from a lost century to the modern age, this novel is a panoramic revelation of things we thought we knew or else had no clue of, as well as a gripping exploration of what goals drive us toward whatever lies in wait&#x2013;an experience resounding with issues, no less relevant today, of crime and spirituality; of identity and nationality; of what we think, what we believe and what we can prove.<br><br>Intriguing, relentless and, most of all, moving, <i>Arthur &amp; George </i>richly extends the reach and achievement of a novelist described by the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> as &#x201c;a dazzling mind in mercurial flight.&#x201d;</p><p>A real <i>tour de force</i> from masterful author Julian Barnes is <i>Arthur &amp; George</i>, which was short-listed for the 2005 Man Booker Prize. Late-Victorian Britain is brought to vivid life in the true story of the intersection of two lives: one an internationally famous author, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and the other, an obscure country lawyer, George Edalji, son of a Parsi Midlands vicar and a Scottish mother. They start out very differently. Arthur pursues a career in medicine before he discovers that he is really a writer; George, on his way to becoming a lawyer--near-sighted, timid and friendless--is victimized by locals because he is easy to scapegoat--a half-Indian in lily-white Great Wyrley. <p> The victimization of George takes the form of nasty letters, the theft of a school key, and finally, the accusation that he has mutilated animals. Meanwhile, Arthur is becoming more and more famous for creating Sherlock Holmes, whom he tries to kill off once and is forced to resurrect because of his fans' outcry. He marries, fathers two children and then, when his wife is invalided by consumption, falls madly in love for the first time with Jean Leckie. </p><p> The novel's style is smoothly revelatory. We slowly come to realize that George is half-Indian, that Arthur is the famous Doyle, that the woman he loves, chastely, is not his wife and, sadly, that George will not prevail over the forces ranged against him. </p><p> When George, desperate to resume his law career after imprisonment, sends Arthur the sad chronicle of his history, Arthur sees immediately that he could not be guilty and sets out to clear his name. This case of George's lifts Arthur from the slough of despond into which he has sunk after his wife, Touie, dies. He is guilt-ridden, constantly wondering if he was attentive enough, if she could possibly have known about Jean. Realizing the immense injustice George has suffered, he is shaken out of lethargy and, in Holmesian fashion, sets out to solve the case. </p><p> Julian Barnes is a gifted writer of enormous accomplishment. This novel is thoroughly engrossing, filled with Barnes's trademark themes of identity and love, longing and loss, and ultimately, an examination of man's inhumanity to man. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>Julian Barnes is the author of two books of stories, two collections of essays, a translation of Alphonse Daudet's <i>In the Land of Pain</i>, and nine previous novels. In France he is the only writer to have won both the Prix M�dicis and the Prix F�mina, and in 2004 he became a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

Hailed by distinguished historians and lionized on his frequent visits to America, he continues to provoke lively debate. The nature and merits of his accomplishments remain tangled in controversy. Rejecting traditional liberal and Marxist "dreams of solidarity," Foucault became the very model of the modern intellectual, replacing Sartre as the figure of the eminent Parisian and cosmopolitan master thinker. </p><p> Foucault himself discouraged biographical questions, claiming that he was "not at all interesting." Didier Eribon's captivating account overthrows that assertion. As a journalist well acquainted with Foucault for years before his death, Eribon was particularly well placed to conduct the dozens of interviews which are the cornerstone of this book. He has drawn upon eyewitness accounts by Foucault's closest associates from all phases of his life--his mother, his schoolteachers, his classmates, his friends and enemies in academic life, and his celebrated companions in political activism, including Simone Signoret and Yves Montand. Eribon has methodically retraced the footsteps of his peripatetic subject, from France to Sweden to Poland to Germany to Tunisia to Brazil to Japan to the United States. The result is a concise, crisply readable, meticulously documented narrative that debunks the many myths and rumors surrounding the brilliant philosophe--and forces us to consider seriously the idea that all his books are indeed, just as Foucault said near the end of his life, "fragments of an autobiography." </p><p> Who was this man, Michel Foucault? In the late 1950s Foucault emerged as a budding young cultural attach�, friendly with Gaullist diplomats. By the mid-1960s he appeared as one of the avatars of structuralism, positioning himself as a new star in the fashionable world of French thought. A few months after the May 1968 student revolt, with Gaullism apparently shaken, he emerged as an ultra-leftist and a fellow traveler of Maoists. Yet during this same period, Eribon shows, he was quietly and adroitly campaigning for a chair in the College de France--the very pinnacle of the French academic system. This book does more than follow the career of one extraordinary intellectual. It reconstructs the cultural, political, and intellectual life of France from the postwar years to the present. It is the story of a man and his time. </p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchA meticulous and authoritative biography of the influential French philosopher and historian, by an editor at Le Nouvel Observateur who was closely acquainted with Foucault during his later years. Foucault (1926-84) is known in this country mainly as one of the prime exemplars of structuralism, the radical school of thought developed in the late 60's and 70's to question the foundations of many social and philosophical systems. In reality, as Eribon makes clear, Foucault was more of an intellectual historian than a philosopher, and achieved his greatest successes when attempting to set forth the ``archaeology'' of a concept or idea. This is what he did in Madness and Civilization, which traced the development of Western notions of sanity and reason as reflected in social attitudes towards madness. His monumental History of Sexuality, left unfinished at his death, was to provide a similar blueprint for the modern understanding of eroticism. Eribon's exposition is readable and clear, and makes good use of the many interviews he held with Foucault during his lifetime, as well as his meetings with Foucault's colleagues and friends. The picture that emerges is of someone at once distant and complex: Foucault hated easy characterizations and refused to ``take sides'' when it came to politics or philosophy. His early dalliance with Marxism quickly gave way in the late 50's, and his later conservatism evaporated as soon as he won his post at the College de France (where, during the 70's and 80's, he became known as one of the most active leftists in the country). Solitary and rather reclusive despite his wide circle of friends, Foucault's public life was largely restricted to his professional writings, and it is to Eribon's credit that he concentrates mainly on these, since they provide the truest picture of Foucault available. Superbly written and carefully documented: Eribon has managed to provide a scholarly exegesis of Foucault that will also serve as a good introduction for the lay reader. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Whether writing about the future of our species on this planet, the folly of our faith in technological progress, or the self-deceptions of the liberal establishment, John Gray dares to be heretical like few other thinkers today.</p><p>John Gray is Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics.Gray, a philosopher and professor at the London School of Economics, sounds like the quintessential grumpy, world-weary intellectual: he disagrees with almost everyone and is pessimistic about almost everything. In these essays, originally published in the New Statesman, he contents himself with criticizing ideas and politics on both the right and left, but proposes little that might solve the problems he sees, apart from a typically contrarian endorsement of the use of torture (arguing that "in a truly liberal society, terrorists have an inalienable right to be tortured") and a wishful argument for why Europe needs to style itself as a "counterweight to American power." The book is divided into three parts: the first expands on Gray's view that humans (he calls them "Homo rapiens") have an apocalyptic capacity for self-destruction; the second looks at the war on terror; and the third focuses on European, mainly British, politics. Many of the essays revolve around current events-the earliest was written in 1999, the most recent in early 2004-but they already feel dated and distant, especially when he refers to the aftermath of 9/11 and the early stages of the Iraq war. Theoretically, Gray's cynical, nonpartisan opinion might appeal to Americans frustrated with the ideological polarization and intransigence of American politics, but his relentlessly crotchety discussion of not-so-current events is most likely to turn off readers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet when his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, suddenly died, the grief-stricken emperor built the world's most beautiful tomb as a monument to her memory. </p><p> Shah Jahan was the fifth emperor of the Mughal dynasty. The Mughals combined the brute force and fierce ambition of their legendary ancestor Genghis Khan with a delicate artistic sensitivity. Theirs was a world where even forts were architectural gems, where emperors had their life stories told in exquisite miniature paintings, and where each new ruler competed with the previous one by building a grander palace, fort, mosque and city. </p><p> The <b>Taj Mahal</b> tells the story of this remarkable dynasty through its greatest artistic achievement. From the soaring domes, to the marble columns inlaid with precious gems, to the vast gardens, to the perfect symmetry of its design, the Taj Mahal expressed the power, grandeur, glory and beauty of the Mughal world. </p></p><p><p> <b>Elizabeth Mann</b> is the author of 11 <i>Wonders of the World</i> books, cited by Booklist as one of the ten best series for young readers. </p><p> <b>Alan Witschonke</b> has illustrated five <i>Wonders of the World</i> books. </p><p><b>Excerpt</b></p> <p>Prince Khurram was flfteen years old when he fell in love. The fourteen year old who captured his heart was as bright and generous as she was beautiful. Four years later, in 1612, they were married. From that day on, Mumtaz Mahal was his constant companion, his trusted advisor, the love of his life. In the Muslim world, where arranged marriages were customary and men were allowed four wives, such devotion to one woman was unusual. She was at his side when he became the emperor of the Mughal Empire and took the title Shah Jahan (World Ruler), and she was at his side when he led armies against rebels in remote and dangerous areas.</p> <p>In 1631 she went with him on a military campaign to a region called the Deccan, far from their palace in Agra. The campaign promised to be long, so the royal court, including the women who attended Mumtaz Mahal, moved to the Deccan with the emperor and his army. Near the town of Burhanpur, they set up a city of tents where life went on much as it had in the palace while the army skirmished with the enemy.</p> <p>In the hot month of June, the mood in the <i>zanana</i> (women's quarters) was tense and excited. Mumtaz Mahal was about to give birth to her 14th child! One night she dreamed that she heard her unborn baby cry. When she told her women about it, tension became fear. Such a dream was a bad omen.</p> <p>At last the infant was born, and fear turned to joy -- the baby girl was healthy. At the sight of the weakened queen lying exhausted against her silken cushions, joy quickly faded. Fearing the worst, Mumtaz Mahal summoned Shah Jahan to her tent. She asked only that he care for her children and then died in his arms.</p> <p>The emperor was devastated. He wept for a week, and it is said that the hair of his beard turned white. He put aside the silk clothing and bright jewels that he had worn all his life and dressed instead in white mourning clothes. He turned away from music, dance, all entertainment. Nothing gave him pleasure.</p> <p>Despite his grief, Shah Jahan was not one to neglect his duties as emperor. He rose at dawn to pray in the tiny mosque in his palace and then took his place in the throne room. He listened patiently as nobles and commoners alike approached him with their problems and requests. He rewarded those who pleased him with gifts of jewels, elephants, and land. For the unlucky, executioners were on hand to carry out swift punishments. Day after day, he forced himself to perform the routines of the imperial court.</p> <p>The only light for Shah Jahan in this time of darkness was his plan to build a tomb for Mumtaz Mahal. This work he embraced eagerly. He wanted to create a paradise for his great queen, and a monument to their love. Thus from the emperor's grief the Taj Mahal was born.</p></p><h2>If Women Ruled the World: How to Create the World We Want to Live In</h2><p>Women are simply not represented in leadership positions in government or corporate America.

Fortunately, Epstein chose fine yarns crocheted with a small hook. The enticing designs that result have a Sixties flair.

We ignored our loose front doorknob until it</p><p>went from shaky to wobbly and finally fell off when we tried to</p><p>exit the house one evening. Dick watched it fall to the hardwood</p><p>floor with a thunk, then looked at me and said, &#x201c;Time to move.&#x201d;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t think we were entirely wrong in holding on to our</p><p>low-intervention policy. Once when Dick and I were walking</p><p>through town, we were stopped by a group of young women</p><p>who were celebrating their friend&#x2019;s upcoming wedding. They</p><p>were asking all the obviously married women they saw for advice</p><p>for the new bride. I said, &#x201c;You know, my life really began</p><p>when I got married.&#x201d; They all laughed and told me that I was the</p><p>first woman they&#x2019;d stopped who hadn&#x2019;t said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d; Then</p><p>I told them that my best advice was not to approach marriage</p><p>like it was an arrangement between property co-owners. It</p><p>seemed to me like too many people spent too much of their time</p><p>taking care of their houses instead of enjoying their spouses.</p><p>And where was the fun in that?</p><p>I liked to think that it was a valid philosophy of life that kept</p><p>me out of the yard, and not just sheer laziness. In any case, to</p><p>me, even worse than digging out a screwdriver to fix our doorknob</p><p>would have been digging in the dirt. I had zero interest in</p><p>that area of our property. I don&#x2019;t think I even really looked at it.</p><p>Then one day, I noticed that our yard had slowly, gradually</p><p>transformed itself. No longer could I flatter myself that it was</p><p>natural and unmanicured because that was the aesthetic I preferred.</p><p>No, our yard wasn&#x2019;t just rough around the edges. It had</p><p>become a genuine embarrassment. Maybe we didn&#x2019;t have the</p><p>worst yard on the block. But we were close to it, and one good</p><p>mowing in our most neglectful neighbor&#x2019;s yard might easily</p><p>nudge us into the bottom slot. And that just wouldn&#x2019;t do. I</p><p>might never have been yard-proud, but I did not want to be</p><p>yard-ashamed.</p><p>So I decided that it was time to do something about this situation.</p><p>It was a fixable problem, after all&#x2014;and how nice it was to</p><p>have one of those.</p><p>When I passed our neighbor Sarah&#x2019;s yard I couldn&#x2019;t help seeing</p><p>what an amazing job her gardener had done. Sarah was a</p><p>master gardener herself, but recently she&#x2019;d gotten busy at work</p><p>and had brought in some help. And even I could tell that a true</p><p>artist was at work there. Maybe I could hire her gardener, I</p><p>thought to myself. And then our yard would be as beautiful as</p><p>hers. It would be healthy and lush and well taken care of&#x2014;</p><p>just the way I wanted to be myself.</p><p>A few days later I saw the mystery gardener in the flesh&#x2014;</p><p>the artist who&#x2019;d wrought such a miracle transformation in my neighbor&#x2019;s</p><p>yard&#x2014;and it was kismet. Love at first sight. No, it wasn&#x2019;t</p><p>the kind of love that causes you to question your marriage. It</p><p>was the kind of love that causes you to question yourself. The</p><p>kind that makes you want to be a better person. The kind that</p><p>changes your life completely.</p><p>His name was Giles Owita, and from the start, something</p><p>flowered between us and around us. First he became my gardener,</p><p>and then he became my friend. And while I knew from</p><p>the moment I met him that he was someone special&#x2014;</p><p>truly, I didn&#x2019;t know the half of it.</p></p><h2>Making Certain It Goes on: The Collected Poems of Richard Hugo</h2><p>Poems written over twenty years deal with nature, travel, art, the past, mortality, friendship, marriage, and memory</p><p>Richard Hugo was, in James Wright&#39;s words, &#39;a great poet, true to our difficult life.&#39; Making Certain It Goes On brings together, as Hugo wished, the poems published in book form during his lifetime, together with the new poems he wrote in his last years.Richard Hugo was for many years the director of the creative writing program at the University of Montana, Missoula Campus.

In these irreverent variations on well-known themes, the ugly duckling grows up to be an ugly duck, and the princess who kisses the frog wins only a mouthful of amphibian slime. <i>The Stinky Cheese Man</i> deconstructs not only the tradition of the fairy tale but also the entire notion of a book. Our naughty narrator, Jack, makes a mockery of the title page, the table of contents, and even the endpaper by shuffling, scoffing, and generally paying no mind to structure. Characters slide in and out of tales; Cinderella rebuffs Rumpelstiltskin, and the Giant at the top of the beanstalk snacks on the Little Red Hen. There are no lessons to be learned or morals to take to heart--just good, sarcastic fun that smart-alecks of all ages will love.Multiple award-winning author Jon Scieszka grew up in Flint, Michigan, the second oldest and the nicest of six boys.

Twenty years ago, Jane Hudson left the Heart Lake School for Girls in the Adirondacks after a terrible tragedy. Now she has returned to the placid, isolated shores of the lakeside school as a Latin teacher, recently separated and hoping to make a fresh start with her young daughter. But ominous messages from the past dredge up forgotten memories that will become a living nightmare.<br><br>Since freshmen year, Jane and her two roommates, Lucy Toller and Deirdre Hall, were inseparable&#x2013;studying the classics, performing school girl rituals on the lake, and sneaking out after curfew to meet Lucy&#x2019;s charismatic brother Matt. However, the last winter before graduation, everything changed. For in that sheltered, ice-encrusted wonderland, three lives were taken, all victims of senseless suicide. Only Jane was left to carry the burden of a mystery that has stayed hidden for more than two decades in the dark depths of Heart Lake. <br><br>Now pages from Jane&#x2019;s missing journal, written during that tragic time, have reappeared, revealing shocking, long-buried secrets. And suddenly, young, troubled girls are beginning to die again . . . as piece by piece the shattering truth slowly floats to the surface.<br><br>At once compelling, sensuous, and intelligent, <i>The Lake of Dead Languages </i>is an eloquent thriller, an intricate balance of suspense and fine storytelling that proves Carol Goodman is a rare new talent with a brilliant future.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, February 2002:</b> It has been 20 years since Jane Hudson graduated from Heart Lake School in the Adirondacks. After marrying, having a child, and separating from her husband, she returns to her old, all-girls school to teach Latin. <p> Heart Lake, like many schools, has its legends, the most persistent being that the lake claims the lives of students. All three daughters of the founder of the school were drowned in it, and while the bodies were never found, it is said that three rocks rose out of the water to lure young girls to their doom. Jane is more than aware of this legend. When she was at school, two of her contemporaries drowned in the lake, and Jane has always felt that it was looking for a third victim--herself. </p><p> While she does not discuss this with her students, she is aware that they know of the legend. Her three most promising students room together, are close to each other, and look on Jane as their special teacher, a situation that mirrors Jane's experience as a student. But soon Jane is into a routine, has renewed her acquaintance with teachers, now colleagues, who are still at Heart Lake, and has met other teachers new to her.</p><p> But when a portion of her journal is left for her to see, Jane is puzzled. She has not seen the journal since she left school. Then one of her students almost drowns in what appears to be a suicide attempt, and Jane realizes that the nightmare she lived through at school may be recurring. </p><p> Jane tries to piece together what really happened in her school days and what is happening now. As a young girl, Jane was poor and managed to get to Heart Lake because she won a scholarship. She was befriended by the charismatic Lucy and her brother Matt, and it is with Lucy that she roomed, together with Deirdre. The three girls bonded with their Latin teacher, Helen Chambers. As we learn more about Jane's school days and contrast it with what is happening 20 years later, it becomes obvious that history is repeating itself--or someone is trying to make it seem that way.</p><p> While it takes a while for the pieces to fall into place, this compelling first novel is as much about the charged atmosphere of adolescents and their new and sometimes dangerous emotions as it is about what exactly is happening at Heart Lake School and why. You will want to know the answers. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p><b>&#x201c;</b>Like Donna Tartt&#x2019;s <i>The Secret History</i> or a good film noir . . .

Here, spring was an illusion, a promise made yet always unkept, a pretence of new life bound by blackened snow and slow-melting ice. Nature had learned to bide its time by the beaches and the bogs, in the Great North Woods of the county and the salt marshes of Scarborough. Let winter hold sway in February and March, beating its slow retreat to the 49th Parallel, refusing to concede even an inch of ground without a fight. As April approached, the willows and poplars, the hazel and the elms had budded amid birdsong. They had been waiting since the fall, their flowers shrouded yet ready, and soon the bogs were carpeted in the purple-brown of alders, and chipmunks and beavers were on the move. The skies bloomed with woodcock, and geese, and grackle, scattering themselves like seeds upon fields of blue.<br> <br>Now May had brought summer at last, and all things were awake.<br> <br>All things.<br> <br>SUNLIGHT SPLASHED ITSELF UPON the window, warming my back with its heat, and fresh coffee was poured into my cup.<br> <br>&#x201c;A bad business,&#x201d; said Kyle Quinn. Kyle, a neat, compact man in pristine whites, was the owner of the Palace Diner in Biddeford. He was also the chef, and he happened to be the cleanest diner chef I&#x2019;d ever seen in my life. I&#x2019;d eaten in diners where the eventual sight of the chef had made me consider undertaking a course of antibiotics, but Kyle was so nicely turned out, and his kitchen so spotless, that there were ICUs with poorer hygiene than the Palace, and surgeons with dirtier hands than Kyle&#x2019;s.<br> <br>The Palace was the oldest diner car in Maine, custom-built by the Pollard Company of Lowell, Massachusetts, its red and white paintwork still fresh and spruce, and the gold lettering on the window that confirmed ladies were, indeed, invited glowed brightly as though written in fire. The diner had opened for business in 1927, and since then five people had owned it, of whom Kyle was the latest. It served only breakfast, and closed before midday, and was one of those small treasures that made daily life a little more bearable.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Bad in the worst way.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Portland Press-Herald was spread before me over the counter of the diner. At the bottom of the front page, beneath the fold, the headline read:<br> NO LEADS IN SLAYING OF STATE TROOPER<p></p> <br>The trooper in question, Foster Jandreau, had been found shot to death in his truck behind the former Blue Moon bar just inside the Saco town line. He hadn&#x2019;t been on duty at the time, and was dressed in civilian clothes when his body was discovered. What he was doing at the Blue Moon, nobody knew, especially since the autopsy revealed that he&#x2019;d been killed sometime after midnight but before 2 a.m., when nobody had any business hanging around the burnt-out shell of an unloved bar. Jandreau&#x2019;s remains were found by a road crew that had pulled into the Moon&#x2019;s parking lot for some coffee and an early morning smoke before commencing the day&#x2019;s work. He had been shot twice at close range with a .22, once in the heart and once in the head. It bore all the hallmarks of an execution.<br> <br>&#x201c;That place was always a magnet for trouble,&#x201d; said Kyle. &#x201c;They should have just razed what was left of it after it burned.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but what would they have put there instead?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A tombstone,&#x201d; said Kyle. &#x201c;A tombstone with Sally Cleaver&#x2019;s name on it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He walked away to pour coffee for the rest of the stragglers, most of whom were reading or talking quietly among themselves, seated in a line like characters in a Norman Rockwell painting. There were no booths at the Palace, and no tables, just fifteen stools. I occupied the last stool, the one farthest from the door. It was after 11:30 a.m., and technically the diner was now closed, but Kyle wouldn&#x2019;t be moving folks along anytime soon. It was that kind of place.<br> <br>Sally Cleaver: her name had been mentioned in the reporting of Jandreau&#x2019;s murder, a little piece of local history that most people might have preferred to forget, and the final nail in the Blue Moon&#x2019;s coffin, as it were. After her death, the bar was boarded up, and a couple of months later it was torched. The owner was questioned about possible arson and insurance fraud, but it was just a matter of routine. The birds in the trees knew that the Cleaver family had put the match to the Blue Moon bar, and nobody uttered a word of blame for it.<br> <br>The bar had now been closed for nearly a decade, a cause of grief for precisely no one, not even the rummies who used to frequent it. Locals always referred to it as the Blue Mood, as nobody ever came out of it feeling better than they had when they went in, even if they hadn&#x2019;t eaten the food or drunk anything that they hadn&#x2019;t seen unsealed in front of them. It was a grim place, a brick fortress topped with a painted sign illuminated by four bulbs, no more than three of which were ever working at any one time. Inside, the lights were kept dim to hide the filth, and all the stools at the bar were screwed to the floor to provide some stability for the drunks. It had a menu right out of the chronic obesity school of cooking, but most of its clientele preferred to fill themselves up on the free beer nuts, salted to within an inch of a stroke in order to encourage the consumption of alcohol. At the end of the evening, the uneaten but heavily pawed nuts that remained were poured back into the big sack that Earle Hanley, the bartender, kept beside the sink. Earle was the only bartender. If he was sick, or had something else more important to do than pickle drunks, the Blue Moon didn&#x2019;t open. Sometimes, if you watched the clientele arriving for their daily fill, it was hard to tell if they were relieved or unhappy to find the door occasionally bolted.<br> <br>And then Sally Cleaver died, and the Moon died with her.<br> <br>There was no mystery about her death. She was twenty-three, and living with a deadbeat named Clifton Andreas, &#x201c;Cliffie&#x201d; to his buddies. It seemed that Sally had been putting a little money aside each week from her job as a waitress, perhaps in the hope of saving enough to have Cliffie Andreas killed, or to convince Earle Hanley to spike his beer nuts with rat poison. I was familiar with Cliffie Andreas as a face around town, one that it was sensible to avoid. Cliffie never met a puppy that he didn&#x2019;t want to drown, or a bug that he didn&#x2019;t want to crush. Any work that he picked up was seasonal, but Cliffie was never likely to qualify for Employee of the Month. Work was something that he did when there was no money left, and he viewed it entirely as a last resort if borrowing, theft, or simply leeching off someone weaker and needier than himself weren&#x2019;t available options. He had a superficial bad boy charm for the kind of woman who assumed a public pose of regarding good men as weak, even as she secretly dreamed of a regular Joe who wasn&#x2019;t mired in the mud at the bottom of the pond and determined to drag someone else down there with him.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know Sally Cleaver. Apparently she had low self-esteem, and lower expectations, but somehow Cliffie Andreas succeeded in reducing the former still further, and failed to live up even to the latter. Anyway, one evening Cliffie found Sally&#x2019;s small, hard-earned stash, and decided to treat himself and his buddies to a free night at the Moon. Sally came home from work, found her money gone, and went looking for Cliffie at his favorite haunt. She found him holding court at the bar, drinking on her dime the Moon&#x2019;s only bottle of cognac, and she decided to stand up for herself for the first, and last, time in her life. She screamed at him, scratched him, tore at his hair, until at last Earle Hanley told Cliffie to take his woman, and his domestic problems, outside, and not to come back until he had both under control.<br> <br>So Cliffie Andreas had grabbed Sally Cleaver by the collar and pulled her through the back door, and the men at the bar had listened while he pounded her into the ground. When he came back inside, his knuckles were raw, his hands were stained red, and his face was flecked with freckles of blood. Earle Hanley poured him another drink and slipped outside to check on Sally Cleaver. By then, she was already choking on her own blood, and she died on the back lot before the ambulance could get to her.<br> <br>And that was it for the Blue Moon, and for Cliffie Andreas. He pulled ten to fifteen in Thomaston, served eight, then was killed less than two months after his release by an &#x201c;unknown assailant&#x201d; who stole Cliffie&#x2019;s watch, left his wallet untouched, and then discarded the watch in a nearby ditch. It was whispered that the Cleavers had long memories.<br> <br>Now Foster Jandreau had died barely yards from the spot on which Sally Cleaver had choked to death, and the ashes of the Moon&#x2019;s history were being raked through once again. Meanwhile, the state police didn&#x2019;t like losing troopers, hadn&#x2019;t liked it since right back in 1924 when Emery Gooch was killed in a motorcycle accident in Mattawamkeag; nor since 1964, when Charlie Black became the first trooper killed by gunfire while responding to a bank raid in South Berwick. But there were shadows around Jandreau&#x2019;s killing. The paper might have claimed that there were no leads, but the rumors said otherwise. Crack vials had been found on the ground by Jandreau&#x2019;s car, and fragments of the same glass were discovered on the floor by his feet. He had no drugs in his system, but there were now concerns on the force that Foster Jandreau might have been dealing on the side, and that would be bad for everyone.<br> <br>Slowly, the diner began to empty, but I stayed where I was until I was the only one remaining at the counter. Kyle left me to myself, making sure that my cup was full before he started cleaning up. The last of the regulars, mostly older men for whom the week wasn&#x2019;t the same without a couple of visits to the Palace, paid their checks and left.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve never had an office. I never had any use for one, and if I had, I probably couldn&#x2019;t have justified the expense of it to myself, even given a favorable rent in Portland or Scarborough. Only a handful of clients had ever commented upon it, and on those occasions when a particular need for privacy and discretion had arisen, I&#x2019;d been in a position to call in favors, and a suitable room had been provided. Occasionally, I used the offices of my attorney up in Freeport, but there were people who disliked the idea of going into a lawyer&#x2019;s office almost as much as they disliked the idea of lawyers in general, and I&#x2019;d found that most of those who came to me for help preferred a more informal approach. Usually, I went to them, and spoke with them in their own homes, but sometimes a diner like the Palace, empty and discreet, was as good as anywhere. In this case, the venue for the meeting had been decided by the prospective client, not by me, and I was fine with it.<br> <br>Shortly after midday, the Palace&#x2019;s door opened, and a man in his mid-sixties entered. He looked like a model for the stereotypical old Yankee: feed cap on his head, an L.L. Bean jacket over a plaid shirt, neat blue denims, and work boots on his feet. He was wiry as a tension cable, his face weathered and lined, light brown eyes glittering behind surprisingly fashionable steel-framed spectacles. He greeted Kyle by name, then removed his hat and gave a courtly little bow to Tara, Kyle&#x2019;s daughter, who was cleaning up behind the counter and who smiled and greeted him in turn.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good to see you, Mr. Patchett,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a while.&#x201d; There was a tenderness to her voice, and a brightness to her eyes, that said all that needed to be said about the new arrival&#x2019;s recent suffering.<br> <br>Kyle leaned through the serving hatch between the kitchen and the counter area. &#x201c;Come to check out a real diner, Bennett?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You look like you could do with some feeding up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bennett Patchett chuckled and swatted at the air with his right hand, as though Kyle&#x2019;s words were insects buzzing at his head, then took a seat beside me. Patchett had owned the Downs Diner, close by the Scarborough Downs racetrack on Route 1, for more than forty years. His father had run it before him, opening it shortly after he returned from service in Europe. There were still pictures of Patchett Senior on the walls of the diner, some of them from his military days, surrounded by younger men who looked up to him as their sergeant. He&#x2019;d died when he was still in his forties, and his son had eventually taken over running the business. Bennett had now lived longer than his own father, just as it seemed that I was destined to live longer than mine.<br> <br>He accepted the offer of a cup of coffee from Tara as he shrugged off his coat and hung it close to the old gas fire. Tara discreetly went to help her father in the kitchen, so that Bennett and I were left alone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Charlie,&#x201d; he said, shaking my hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;How you doing, Mr. Patchett?&#x201d; I asked. It felt odd to be calling him by his last name. It made me feel about ten years old, but when it came to such men, you waited until they gave you permission to be a little more familiar in your mode of address. I knew that all his staff called him &#x201c;Mr. Patchett.&#x201d; He might have been like a father figure to some of them, but he was their boss, and they treated him with the respect that he deserved.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can call me Bennett, son. The less formal this is, the better. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever spoken with a private detective before, except you, and that was only when you were eating in my place. Only ever saw them on TV, and in the movies. And, truth to tell, your reputation makes me a little nervous.&#x201d;<br> <br>He peered at me, and I saw his eye linger briefly on the scar on my neck. A bullet had grazed me there the previous year, deep enough to leave a permanent mark. In recent times, I seemed to have accumulated a lot of similar nicks and scratches. When I died, they could put me in a display case as an example to others who might be tempted to follow a similar path of beatings, gunshot wounds, and electrocution. Then again, I might just have been unlucky. Or lucky. It depended upon how you looked at the glass.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t believe everything you hear,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t, and you still concern me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shrugged. He had a sly smile on his face.<br> <br>&#x201c;But no point in hemmin&#x2019; and hawin&#x2019;,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;I want to thank you for taking the time to meet with me. I know that you&#x2019;re probably a busy man.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t, but it was nice of him to suggest that I might be. Since my license had been restored to me earlier in the year, following some misunderstandings with the Maine State Police, things had been kind of quiet. I&#x2019;d done a little insurance work, all of it dull and most of it involving nothing more strenuous than sitting in a car and turning the pages of a book while I waited for some doofus with alleged workplace injuries to start lifting heavy stones in his yard. But insurance work was thin on the ground, what with the economy being the way it was. Most private detectives in the state were struggling, and I had been forced to accept any work that came along, including the kind that made me want to bathe in bleach when I was done. I&#x2019;d followed a man named Harry Milner while he serviced three separate women in the course of one week in various motels and apartments, as well as holding down a regular job and taking his kids to baseball practice. His wife had suspected that he was having an affair but, unsurprisingly, she was shocked to hear that her husband was engaged in the type of extensive sexual entanglements usually associ...</p><h2>The Winshaw Legacy: or, What a Carve Up!</h2><p>If Charles Dickens and Agatha Christie had ever managed to collaborate, they might have produced this shamelessly entertaining novel, which introduces readers to what may be the most powerful family in England--and is certainly the vilest. A tour de force of menace, malicious comedy, and torrential social bile, this book marks the American debut of an extraordinary writer.</p><p>Born in Birmingham in 1961, Jonathan Coe took degrees from Cambridge and Warwick universities. He lives in London.In this patchily entertaining postmodern pastiche of class warfare, Coe places Michael Owen, a burnt-out middle-class writer, as the family chronicler of the Winshaws, an upper-class British dynasty involved in everything wrong with modern England: television and tabloid journalism (Hilary, the hack); Thatcherite politics and National Health Service Reform (Henry, the back-stabber); industrialized agriculture (the beastly Dorothy); insider stock trading (Thomas, the voyeur); and arms dealing with Iraq (the callous Mark). Coe's contemporary vile bodies are not only utterly unprincipled, greedy and philistine, but their presentation is uninspired and unamusing as well, contracting these issues down to a distinctly parochial dimension. Sandwiching their corrupt stories is an intricate comic plot out of the murder-at-the-manor genre, weirdly reflected in Owen's obsession with an old movie in which he is convinced he stars and which determines his fate. Coe's dry, deflating Midlands sense of humor infrequently rises above the episodes of scrupulously didactic satire and works well with the more quotidian social ills, such as telly-addiction and the unending waits in NHS hospitals. The narrative becomes more interesting toward the end, when Coe gets around to murdering a number of his characters, but since they never become quite real in the first place, the reader doesn't really care. A story closer to this mundane Britain of post-Thatcher disaffection would have been more welcome for his American debut than agitprop Waugh-mongering. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hawai&#39;i: A Sense Of Place: Island Interior Design</h2><p>Hawaii, A Sense of Place: Island Interior Design shows the development of home design in the islands as it incorporates the influences of a balmy climate, lush natural environment and richly diverse cultures.

In <i>The Truth About Forever</i>, when asked how she is coping with her father's death, invariably seventeen year old Macy Queen's answer is "fine," when nothing could be further from the truth. In actuality, she is drowning in grief while maintaining a flawless fa�ade of good grades and unblemished behavior. Though she feels lost when her boyfriend heads to "Brain Camp" for the summer, she finds herself a job with the quirky Wish Catering crew, and meets "sa-woon"-worthy Wes, whose chaotic lifestyle is in direct opposition to her own. As the two share their stories over the summer, Macy realizes she can no longer keep her feelings on ice. Though it feels like her future endedwith her dad's death, Macy's learns that forever is all about beginnings. Dessen charts Macy's navigation of grief in such an honest way it will touch every reader who meets her. All of the Dessen trademarks are here: a girl in transition, a wonderfully fleshed out cast of secondary characters, and of course, the luminous, powerful writing itself. <i>The Truth About Forever</i> will more than satisfy Dessen's legion of fans, and will win her countless more as well.

What did William Tell do that was so special? Why is Joan of Arc so famous?

Lorna is the founder and Executive Director of Crossroads Story Center, Inc. a not-for-profit reaching at-risk youth. <br><p> </p>Grade 3-6-A great book for kids who are interested in storytelling. It has simple versions of many medieval tales arranged by country: from England, "Robin Hood"; from Switzerland, "William Tell"; from France, "Joan of Arc"; and from Scotland, Robert Bruce. (It is somewhat disconcerting that the more common appellation Robert the Bruce is not used). There are tales of Beowulf and of Saladin, and lesser-known ones such as the story of Duke Lech of Poland. Each of the selections is about a page in length, short enough to learn easily. Each chapter includes a "tips" section, a history of the story, and a pronunciation guide. The final section describes the role of the storyteller in medieval times and includes a chapter on how to look and sound like one. The author tells readers how to tailor the story to the audience, but she does not mention that it need not be memorized and repeated verbatim. One of the first rules in most storytelling classes is that the tellers should become comfortable with the material and make it their own. Apart from that, this is a helpful guide. There is a good glossary of medieval terms and comprehensive source notes.<br><i>Marlyn K.

One of the few memoirs of combat in World War II by a distinguished African-American flier, it is also perhaps the only account of the African-American experience in a German prison camp.Alexander Jefferson was one of 32 Tuskegee Airmen from the 332nd Fighter Group to be shot down defending a country that considered them to be second-class citizens. A Detroit native, Jefferson enlisted in 1942, trained at Tuskegee Institute, Alabama, became a second lieutenant in 1943, and joined one of the mostdecorated fighting units in the War, flying P51s with their legendary-and feared -red tails.Based in Italy, Jefferson flew bomber escort missions over southern Europe before being shot down in France in 1944. Captured, he spent the balance of the war in Luftwaffe prison camps in Sagan and Moosberg, Germany.In this vividly detailed, deeply personal book, Jefferson writes as a genuine American hero and patriot. It&#39;s an unvarnished look at life behind barbed wire- and what it meant to be an African-American pilot in enemy hands. It&#39;s also a look at race and democracy in America through the eyes of a patriot who fought toprotect the promise of freedom.The book features the sketches, drawings, and other illustrations Jefferson created during his nine months as a kriegie(POW) and Lewis Carlson&#39;s authoritative background to the man, his unit, and the fight Alexander Jefferson fought so well.</p><p><br><strong>Lt. Col. Alexander Jefferson, (USAF, Ret.)</strong> has degrees from Clark College and Wayne State University. He won numerous citations and remains active in Veterans' and Tuskegee Airmen organizations. He served in Michigan public schools for thirty years as a teacher and administrator, and lives in outside Detroit in Southfield.<br><br><strong>LEWIS H.CARLSON </strong>is co-author of Life behindBarbed Wire: The World War II Photographs ofPrisoner of War Angelo M. Spinelli (Fordham).<br>Jefferson, a Tuskegee Airman who was shot down during World War II and held in a German prison camp for nine months, recalls better treatment as a prisoner of war than as a black citizen in the U.S. He had been fascinated with airplanes since his childhood in Detroit, where he was born into a long line of clergymen and educators, who nonetheless suffered the racial indignities of the time. Jefferson went on to become a chemist when the chance to join the 332nd Fighter Group captured his imagination. He piloted a Red-Tail Angel, one of the planes assigned to protect bombers' crews. On his eighteenth mission, he was shot down over southern France and taken to Stalag Luft III, a camp primarily for captured British and American Air Force officers. While at the camp, he began recording observations of the cold, occasional shootings of prisoners, but mostly boredom and hunger. Later, he recorded his impressions of the ignominious welcome home reserved for black soldiers. Photographs and Jefferson's drawings during his imprisonment add to the fascination of this memoir. <i>Vanessa Bush</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

So who should turn up but Lady Teldra, the courtly servant of my old friend the Dragonlord Morrolan?<br><br>Teldra wants my help, because Morrolan and Aliera have disappeared, and according to Sethra Lavode, it looks like they may be in the hands of the Jenoine. Do I want to mess with them? The guys who made this place? And I thought I had problems before...<br><br>Oh well, what's a little cosmic battle with beings who control time and space? It's better than hunkering down in the woods without even so much as a drinkable cup of klava.<br></p><p>Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and raised in a family of Hungarian labor organizers, Steven Brust worked as a musician and a computer programmer before coming to prominence as a writer in 1983 with <i>Jhereg</i>, the first of his novels about Vlad Taltos, a human professional assassin in a world dominated by long-lived, magically-empowered human-like "Dragaerans." <br><br>Over the next several years, several more "Taltos" novels followed, interspersed with other work, including <i>To Reign in Hell</i>, a fantasy re-working of Milton's war in Heaven; <i>The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars</i>, a contemporary fantasy based on Hungarian folktales; and a science fiction novel, <i>Cowboy Feng's Space Bar and Grille</i>. The most recent "Taltos" novels are <i>Dragon</i> and<i> Issola</i>. In 1991, with <i>The Phoenix Guards</i>, Brust began another series, set a thousand years earlier than the Taltos books; its sequels are <i>Five Hundred Years After</i> and the three volumes of "The Viscount of Adrilankha": <i>The Paths of the Dead, The Lord of Castle Black, </i>and<i> Sethra Lavode</i>.<br><br>While writing, Brust has continued to work as a musician, playing drums for the legendary band Cats Laughing and recording an album of his own work, A Rose for Iconoclastes. He lives in Las Vegas, Nevada where he pursues an ongoing interest in stochastics. <br><b>1</b><br>Adapting Behavior to Environment<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Just because they really are out to get you doesn't mean you aren't paranoid. If they've been after you long enough, paranoia can become a reflex.<br>Interesting things, reflexes: if you pay attention to them, you'll stand to learn some interesting things about yourself. This is one reason I avoid paying attention to my reflexes.<br>But sometimes I can't help it.<br>Let me pick an example at random:<br>I awoke almost instantly from a sound sleep to active stillness, and before reaching for a weapon, or dodging from a possible attack, or even opening my eyes, I reached out, mentally, psychically, for contact with my familiar. My mind to his, I said, "<i>What's going on, Loiosh</i>?" At that instant, all I knew was that something had happened to wake me up. I didn't even remember where I was, though one patch of ground in the wilderness is much like another, and that's where I'd been sleeping lately.<br>My first real clue that there might be a problem came when he didn't make any wisecracks. Instead there was a moment of mental silence, if you'll excuse the expression, and then Loiosh said, "<i>We may have been hunted down, Boss</i>."<br>"<i>Well</i>," I said. "<i>That wouldn't be good</i>."<br>Pretending to be calm to my familiar helps me to actually be calm. Loiosh accepts this as part of his job, and doesn't give me grief about it, much. In the meantime, without any conscious decision on my part, I was holding a neat, slim stiletto in my hand. Reflexes again.<br>I remained still, counting on Loiosh to tell me if and when I ought to move. While I waited, I contemplated my circumstances--in particular, the sharp, nasty stone that had insinuated itself onto the ground between my shoulder blades. I had a thick layer of" darr skin between me and the ground, and a thin layer of chreotha fur between me and the sky.<br>"<i>Brigands, do you think, Loiosh</i>?"<br>"<i>Brigands come in bands, Boss. Whoever this is, there's only one of him</i>."<br>"<i>So the Jhereg is more likely</i>."<br>"<i>Or something else entirely</i>."<br>I heard Rocza shift, caught the faint psychic whispers of Loiosh telling her to stay still, just to fill you in on the basics, in case we haven't met before, Rocza is Loiosh's mate, which I'm sure must answer every question you have.<br>"<i>Coming closer, Boss</i>."<br>"<i>Do I have a target, yet</i>?"<br>"<i>No</i>."<br>"<i>Do you have any suggestions</i>?"<br>"<i>No. But I'm not worried, Boss. I'm sure you'll come up with a plan</i>."<br>Reptiles are cold-blooded; a reptilian sense of humor will naturally display the same characteristics. This, in spite of being hunted and hounded by a massive and murderous criminal society that wants nothing less than the destruction of my soul, is probably the greatest burden I carry.<br>"<i>All right</i>," I said, ignoring his remark. "<i>Fly as silently as you can away from whoever it is, and circle around. As soon as you see</i>--"<br>I was interrupted by the ostentatious clearing of a throat, followed by someone saying, "I beg your pardon for disturbing you at such an hour, Lord Taltos, but I'm certain you must be awake by now, and I'm afraid if I come any closer you might do something I'd regret."<br>I sat up, the knife poised for throwing. "You can't be who you sound like," I said.<br>"I am, though."<br>"It's not polite to lie."<br>She laughed. "Nor to accuse a friend of lying."<br>"You can't be--"<br>"<i>It is, Boss</i>."<br>"Well," 1 said after a long moment. "I'll be skinned for a norska."<br>"<i>Probably</i>," said Loiosh. "<i>But not by her</i>."<br>I heard her come a little closer; Loiosh could now see her, but 1 can't see as well at night as he can.<br>"<i>Don't feel bad, Boss. We can't all have adequate vision</i>."<br>"<i>At least both of my eyes face forward, scavenger</i>."<br>"Mind if I make a light?" I said.<br>"Please do."<br>I stood up slowly, put my knife away, and found my firekit close at hand. I lit a candle and held it up and away so we would both be illuminated. There was, fortunately, little wind. I saw her standing before me, looking very beautiful and incredibly out of place. She gave me a courtesy, and I bowed in response.<br>"Lord Taltos," she said.<br>"Lady Teldra," 1 replied. "Welcome to the wilderness."<br>She looked around. "Yes. Well, shall I start, or should it wait until morning?"<br>"If it is urgent enough to track me down in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night, can it wait until morning?"<br>"It can, Lord Taltos. My urgency was to find you before you moved on, thus making the search more difficult. Again, 1 apologize for disturbing you."<br>"Not to worry. Did you bring any blankets?"<br>"I..."<br>"I know bow difficult this must be for you, Lady Teldra, and I can't wait to hear about what brought it all about, but, believe me, we'll both be better off if you let me handle things for tonight. I'd prefer it that way. Please."<br>"Very well."<br>"Did you bring any blankets?"<br>"No."<br>"Is anyone following you?"<br>"No."<br>"Are you--forgive me--are you certain?"<br>"Yes."<br>I studied her face. Lady Teldra was worried about something. She was worried enough about something that she had allowed it to appear on her features, and something was wrong enough for her to have deliberately woken me up. This was almost more startling than her sudden appearance in the forest between Appertown and Ridge.<br>Startling. Yes.<br>When one knows an Issola, such as Lady Teldra, one gets so used to the grace, elegance, and manners of the House that one forgets its other side. The issola is a beautiful white bird. I'd seen several during my recent travels. One usually saw them standing, graceful and lovely in the early morning or late evening, in swamps or the shallow banks of rivers. They stand as if their only reason for being were to look lovely and graceful. And then the issola would be holding a fish in its beak, and you'd never see it strike. And then the fish would be gone in a single swallow, and the issola would be standing on one leg, looking lovely and graceful.<br>Lady Teldra looked lovely and graceful. I felt plain and clumsy. On the other hand, now that the adrenaline was no longer coursing through my system I realized that I was still pretty tired.<br>"Let's sleep," I said. "You can share my furs, as long as you don't get forward with me."<br>"My lord--"<br>"I'm kidding. Climb in."<br>I blew out the candle. It had been a long time since I'd slept curled up with a warm body--it brought back memories that I'd been trying to suppress, and the fact that she wasn't human did little to help me forget. There had been a time when, every night, I had gone to sleep next to a woman I loved, and, even better, woken up with her. Those days were over and beyond recall, and allowing myself to dwell on them could take from me the edge I needed to stay alert and alive.<br>It took a while, but eventually I fell asleep, and when I woke up it was dawn, and she had climbed out of the furs and had a fire going.<br>"Have you klava?" she said, when she saw I was awake.<br>"Not even coffee," I said. "But we're within a few miles of a town."<br>"Really? I'd have thought you'd stay at an inn, then."<br>"Loiosh works better out here, and these days I'm thinking more about survival than comfort."<br>"I'm sorry," she said, and seemed to mean it. But, of course, she was an Issola: she would always seem to mean it. In the light of dawn, I saw that she was dressed in white and green, in a gown suited less to the wilderness than to her duties at Castle Black, home of the Lord Morrolan, where she'd welcome you into his home, serve you wine, and convincingly seem delighted to see you. For almost the first time in the years that I'd known her, I wondered: Just exactly what <i>were</i> her duties for Morrolan?<br>She looked an inquiry at me, then held out her hand. I nodded and Loiosh flew over to her, landing delicately. Her hand was stiff and slightly tilted, her elbow sharply bent: she knew the technique, though as far as I knew she'd never held a jhereg before. This failed to startle me.<br>"A pleasure to see you," she told my familiar.<br>He gracefully lowered his head until it was below the level of her hand, then raised it again.<br>"I believe," said Lady Teldra in an amused tone, "that I am being mocked." I heard Loiosh giggle inside my head. He turned around on her hand, launched himself, and returned to my right shoulder. Rocza, by now on my left shoulder, shifted and wriggled, which she often did in the morning. It probably meant something. There are many interesting facets to the character of the wild jhereg--poisonous reptilian scavengers of the jungle--but for some reason I got stubborn and decided not to learn about them. I imagine Teldra knew a lot about the wild issola.<br>"I'll bet you know a lot about the wild issola," I said.<br>"I know a bit about them," she said. "But, your pardon Lord Taltos, I should imagine that isn't the question foremost on your mind."<br>"No, foremost on my mind is breakfast. There's bread, cheese, and the remains of a dried and salted wild boar in my pack, as well some dried gammon and jerky in my pouch. Help yourself while I vanish for a moment and get myself a little cleaned up. There's a stream about a hundred feet this way, just over that rise."<br>"Thank you, my lord. I found it earlier."<br>I went off and did what was necessary and filled my water flask. When I returned Teldra had broken off several chunks of bread and, while they toasted on the rocks next to the fire, she was cutting up strips of cheese to lay across them.<br>"No questions before you eat?" she said.<br>"Exactly."<br>"I can respect that."<br>The bread started smelling good. When she put the cheese over it, and the boar, my mouth started watering. The cheese was a smokey honin; I usually prefer something sharper, but it went well with boar. We ate, and I passed the water flask over. I almost apologized for the lack of wine, but Teldra would have been mortified to hear me apologize, so I didn't. The food was good. As I ate, I fed bits to Loiosh, some of which he passed on to Rocza.<br>When I...</p><h2>A Way of Working: The Spiritual Dimension of Craft</h2><p>In this enriching collection of eleven interrelated essays, <i>A Way of Working</i> explores the ancient relationship of art, order, and craft. Craft is considered as a "sort of ark" for the transmission of real knowledge about being, and about our deep creative aspirations. The book includes contributions from D. M. Dooling, Joseph Cary, Paul Jordan-Smith, Michael Donner, Harry Remde, Jean Kinkead Martine, Jean Sulzberger, Chanit Roston, and P. L. Travers. This group of authors write not as individuals but as members of a community &#x2014; a guild effort. As one chapter heading put it: the alchemy of craft.</p><p></p><h2>A Wind in the Door (The Time Quartet)</h2><p>A <i>Wind In The Door</i> is a&nbsp;&nbsp;fantastic adventure story involving Meg Murry, her small&nbsp;&nbsp;brother Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe, the&nbsp;&nbsp;chief characters of <i>A Wrinkle In&nbsp;&nbsp;Time</i>. The seed from which the story grows is the&nbsp;&nbsp;rather ordinary situation of Charles Wallace's&nbsp;&nbsp;having difficulty in adapting to school. He is&nbsp;&nbsp;extremely bright, so much so that he gets punched around&nbsp;&nbsp;a lot for being "different." He is also&nbsp;&nbsp;strangely, seriously ill (mitochondritis -- the&nbsp;&nbsp;destruction of farandolae, minute creature of the&nbsp;&nbsp;mitochondria in the blood). Determined to help&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Wallace in school, Meg pays a visit to his&nbsp;&nbsp;principal, Mr. Jenkins, a dry, cold man with whom Meg&nbsp;&nbsp;herself has had unfortunate run-ins. The interview&nbsp;&nbsp;with Mr. Jenkins goes badly and Meg worriedly&nbsp;&nbsp;returns home to find Charles Wallace waiting for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are," he announces, "dragons in&nbsp;&nbsp;the twins' vegetable garden. Or there were. They've&nbsp;&nbsp;moved to the north pasture now." <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragons ? Not really, but an entity, a being&nbsp;&nbsp;stranger by far than dragons; and the encounter with this&nbsp;&nbsp;alien creature is only the first step that leads&nbsp;&nbsp;Meg, Calvin, and Mr. Jenkins out into galactic&nbsp;&nbsp;space, and then into the unimaginably small world of a&nbsp;&nbsp;mitochondrion. And, at last, safely, triumphantly,&nbsp;&nbsp;home.</p><p>"There are dragons in the twins' vegetable garden," announces six-year-old Charles Wallace Murry in the opening sentence of <i>The Wind in the Door</i>. His older sister, Meg, doubts it. She figures he's seen <i>something</i> strange, but dragons--a "dollop of dragons," a "drove of dragons," even a "drive of dragons"--seem highly unlikely. As it turns out, Charles Wallace is right about the dragons--though the sea of eyes (merry eyes, wise eyes, ferocious eyes, kitten eyes, dragon eyes, opening and closing) and wings (in constant motion) is actually a benevolent cherubim (of a singularly plural sort) named Proginoskes who has come to help save Charles Wallace from a serious illness.<p> In her usual masterful way, Madeleine L'Engle jumps seamlessly from a child's world of liverwurst and cream cheese sandwiches to deeply sinister, cosmic battles between good and evil. Children will revel in the delectably chilling details--including hideous scenes in which a school principal named Mr. Jenkins is impersonated by the Echthroi (the evil forces that tear skies, snuff out light, and darken planets). When it becomes clear that the Echthroi are putting Charles Wallace in danger, the only logical course of action is for Meg and her dear friend Calvin O'Keefe to become small enough to go inside Charles Wallace's body--into one of his mitochondria--to see what's going wrong with his farandolae. In an illuminating flash on the interconnectedness of all things and the relativity of size, we realize that the tiniest problem can have mammoth, even intergalactic ramifications. Can this intrepid group voyage through time and space and muster all their strength of character to save Charles Wallace? It's an exhilarating, enlightening, suspenseful journey that no child should miss.</p><p> The other books of the Time quartet, continuing the adventures of the Murry family, are <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>; <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet</i>, which won the American Book Award; and <i>Many Waters</i>. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p>Madeleine L'Engle is the author of more than forty-five books for all ages, among them the beloved <i>A Wrinkle in Time,</i> awarded the Newbery Medal; <i>A Ring of Endless Light,</i> a Newbery Honor Book; <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet,</i> winner of the American Book Award; and the Austin family series of which <i>Troubling a Star</i> is the fifth book. L'Engle was named the 1998 recipient of the Margaret A. Edwards award, honoring her lifetime contribution in writing for teens.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle was born in 1918 in New York City, late in her parents' lives,an only child growing up in an adult world. Her father was a journalist who had been a foreign correspondent, and although he suffered from mustard gas poisoning in World War I, his work still took him abroad a great deal. Her mother was a musician; the house was filled with her parents' friends: artists, writers, and musicians. "Their lives were very full and they didn't really have time for a child," she says. "So I turned to writing to amuse myself."<br><br>When she was 12, Ms. L'Engle moved with her family to the French Alps in search of purer air for her father's lungs. She was sent to an English boarding school --"dreadful," she says. When she was 14, her family returned to America and she went to boarding school once again, Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina--which she loved. When she was 17, her father died.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle spent the next four years at Smith College. After graduating cum laude, she and an assortment of friends moved to an apartment in Greenwich Village. "I still wanted to be a writer; I always wanted to be a writer, but I had to pay the bills, so I went to work in the theater," she says.<br><br>Touring as an actress seems to have been a catalyst for her. She wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain,</i> while touring with Eva Le Gallienne in <i>Uncle Harry</i>. She met Hugh Franklin, to whom she was married until his death in 1986, while they were rehearsing <i>The Cherry Orchard,</i> and they were married on tour during a run of <i>The Joyous Season,</i> starring Ethel Barrymore.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle retired from the stage after her marriage, and the Franklins moved to northwest Connecticut and opened a general store. "The surrounding area was real dairy farmland then, and very rural. Some of the children had never seen books when they began their first year of school," she remembers. The Franklins raised three children--Josephine, Maria, and Bion. Ms. L'Engle's first book in the Austin quintet, <i>Meet the Austins,</i> an ALA Notable Children's Book, has strong parallels with her life in the country. But she says, "I identify with Vicky rather than with Mrs. Austin, since I share all of Vicky's insecurities, enthusiasms, and times of sadness and growth."<br><br>When, after a decade in Connecticut, the family returned to New York, Ms. L'Engle rejoiced. "In some ways, I was back in the real world." Mr. Franklin resumed acting, and became well known as Dr. Charles Tyler in the television series <i>All My Children.</i> <i>Two-Part Invention</i> is Ms. L'Engle's touching and critically acclaimed story of their long and loving marriage. <br><br>The Time quintet--<i>A Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters,</i> and <i>An Acceptable Time</i>--are among her most famous books, but it took years to get a publisher to accept <i>A Wrinkle in Time.</i> "Every major publisher turned it down. No one knew what to do with it," she says. When Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux finally accepted the manuscript, she insisted that they publish it as a children's book. It was the beginning of their children's list."<br><br>Today, Ms. L'Engle lives in New York City and Connecticut, writing at home and at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, where she is variously the librarian and the writer-in-residence. "It depends from day-to-day on what they want to call me. I do keep the library collection--largely theology, philosophy, a lot of good reference books--open on a volunteer basis."<br><b>Author Fun Facts<br><br></b><i>Born<br></i>November 29 in New York City<br><br><i>Education<br></i>Smith College, The New School, Columbia University<br><br><i>Currently lives<br></i>New York City and Connecticut<br><br><i>Fun Jobs<br></i>Librarian, actress<br><br><i>Favorite...<br></i>...hobbies: traveling, reading, playing the piano, and cooking<br><b>A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle<br><br>"</b>I wrote my first story when I was 5. It was about a little G-R-U-L, because that&#x2019;s how I spelled &#x201c;girl&#x201d; when I was 5. I wrote because I wanted to know what everything was about. My father, before I was born, had been gassed in the first World War, and I wanted to know why there wer wars, why people hurt each other, why we couldn&#x2019;t get along together, and what made people tick. That&#x2019;s why I started to write stories.<br><br>The books I read most as a child were by Lucy Maud Montgomery, who&#x2019;s best known for her Anne of Green Gables stories, but I also liked Emily of New Moon. Emily was an only child, as I was. Emily lived on an island, as did I. Although Manhattan Island and Prince Edward Island are not very much alike, they are still islands. Emily&#x2019;s father was dying of bad lungs, and so was mine. Emily had some dreadful relative, and so did I. She had a hard time in school, and she also understood that there&#x2019;s more to life than just the things that can be explained by encyclopedias and facts. Facts alone are not adequate. I love Emily. I also read E. Nesbit, who was a nineteenth-century writer of fantasies and family stories, and I read fairy tales and the myths of all countries. And anything I could get my hands on.<br><br>As an adult, I like to read fiction. I really enjoy good murder mystery writers, usually women, frequently English, because they have a sense of what the human soul is about and why people do dark and terrible things. I also read quite a lot in the area of particle physics and quantum mechanics, because this is theology. This is about the nature of being. This is what life is all about. I try to read as widely as I possibly can.<br><br>I wrote <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> when we were living in a small dairy farm village in New England. I had three small children to raise, and life was not easy. We lost four of our closest friends within two years by death--that&#x2019;s a lot of death statistically. And I really wasn&#x2019;t finding the answers to my big questions in the logical places. So, at the time I discovered the world of particle physics. I discovered Einstein and relativity. I read a book of Einstein&#x2019;s, in which he said that anyone who&#x2019;s not lost in rapturous awe at the power and glory of the mind behind the universe is as good as a burnt-out candle. And I thought, &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve found my theologian, what a wonderful thing.&#x201d; I began to read more in that area. <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> came out of these questions, and out of my discovery of the post-utopian sciences, which knocked everything we knew about science for a loop.<br><br><i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> was almost never published. You can&#x2019;t name a major publisher who didn&#x2019;t reject it. And there were many reasons. One was that it was supposedly too hard for children. Well, my children were 7, 10, and 12 while I was writing it. I&#x2019;d read to them at night what I&#x2019;d written during the day, and they&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Ooh, mother, go back to the typewriter!&#x201d; <i>A Wrinkle in Time&#x201d; </i>had a female protagonist in a science fiction book, and that wasn&#x2019;t done. And it dealt with evil and things that you don&#x2019;t find, or didn&#x2019;t at that time, in children&#x2019;s books. When we&#x2019;d run through forty-odd publishers, my agent sent it back. We gave up. Then my mother was visiting for Christmas, and I gave her a tea party for some of her old friends. One of them happened to belong to a small writing group run by John Farrar, of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, which at that time did not have a juvenile list. She insisted that I meet John any how, and I went down with my battered manuscript. John had read my first novel and liked it, and read this book and loved it. That&#x2019;s how it happened.<br><br>The most asked question that I generally receive is, &#x201c;Where do you get your ideas?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s very easily answered. I tell a story about Johann Sebastian Bach when he was an old man. A student asked him, &#x201c;Papa Bach, where do you get the ideas for all of these melodies?&#x201d; And the old man said, &#x201c;Why, when I get up in the morning, it&#x2019;s all I can do not to trip over them.&#x201d; And that&#x2019;s how ideas are; they&#x2019;re just everywhere. I think the least asked question is one that I got in Japan. This little girl held up her hand and said, &#x201c;How tall are you?&#x201d; In Japan, I am very tall.<br><br>I get over one hundred letters a week. There are always letters that stand out. There was one from a 12-year-old girl in North Carolina who wrote me many years ago, saying &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jewish and most of my friends are Christian. My Christian friends told me only Christians can be saved. What do you think? Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d; Well, we corresponded for about twenty years. I suggested that she go back to read some of the great Jewish writers to find out about her own tradition. Another letter asked, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re studying the crusades in school. Can there be such a thing as a Holy War? Is war ever right?&#x201d; I mean, kids don&#x2019;t hesitate to ask questions. And it&#x2019;s a great honor to have the kids say, &#x201c;Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d;<br><br>The questions are not always about the books. They&#x2019;re sometimes about the deepest issues of life. &#x201c;Why did my parents put my grandmother in a nursing home?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s one that has come up several times. The letters are enlightening, particularly when t...</p><h2>The Hangman&#39;s Secret: A Victorian Mystery</h2><p><b>From award-winning author Laura Joh Rowland, a story about the darkness that lurks within and the deadly secrets that beg to be revealed.<br><br><i>Intrepid photographer Sarah Bain and her motley crew of friends are back to hunt criminals in the dark, seedy underbelly of Victorian London, but little do they know, the darkness may lurk closer than they first divined.</i></b><br><br>Photographer Sarah Bain and her friends Lord Hugh Staunton and sometime street urchin Mick O&#x2019;Reilly are private detectives with a new gig&#x2014;photographing crime scenes for London&#x2019;s Daily World newspaper.

Its popularity in the nineteenth century was immense and there was a huge export market from Britain to Europe and America. Practically every pottery in the north of England had a go at this new and exciting form of decoration. There have been surprisingly few books on lustreware and most of those that have appeared have suffered from a lack of coloured illustrations, almost an essential for a proper coverage of and understanding of the subject. With this new book the situation is redressed. Of the 300 illustrations some 150 are in colour and large numbers in both categories are of pieces, some extremely rare, that have never been seen in print before. Among these are examples from the vast but little-known Gutman collection in the United States, to which country large quantities of lustreware were exported in the nineteenth century.

Reproduced here are many of the thousands of photographs he took in New York&#39;s Harlem between the wars. 200 photos.</p><p>VanDerZee was the first 20th-century African American photographer to achieve commercial success and fame. Between the wars, he ran a photography studio in Harlem, where he documented the famous and the everyday of the Harlem Renaissance more thoroughly than any other photographer. Thanks to the inclusion of some of his images in the 1969 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition "Harlem on My Mind," he was rediscovered at age 83, living in poverty in Harlem. Before he died, he again took up the camera to photograph many prominent African Americans, including Muhammad Ali, Romare Bearden, and Bill Cosby. Published on the occasion of an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, this first major survey of his work in 20 years presents a full retrospective in high-quality reproductions.

Readers will become captivated, as is Wilmet, with the lives and personalities of characters such as the kleptomaniac Wilf Bason, the priests Keith, and Piers Longridge. She fancies herself in love with Piers, the brother of a close friend, and imagines he is her secret admirer (the admirer is in fact her friend&#39;s husband).

While powerful, they were also limiting, because there weren't enough to go around. Wicca exploded when it expanded to include solitary paths as part of the religion. Now the Craft is rapidly growing in numbers and many people are looking for the community which was previously part of the Craft. I am very glad that Llewellyn has now published the ultimate guide to Witchcraft for three or more people, <i>Covencraft</i> by Amber K. <br> <br>Virtually every aspect of the coven experience is included in <i>Covencraft</i>. Do you want to find a coven? This book shows you how. Do you want to organize a coven? <i>Covencraft</i> gives you the techniques. <br> <br>You'll learn how to get new members, how to take care of business and finance, and how the leaders should serve the group. Included are initiation rituals, handfasting rituals, child blessing rituals, and more. You'll even discover information on how to incorporate. <br> <br>Amber K. has written several books and numerous articles about Wicca and Witchcraft. She has served as National First Officer and National Publications Officer of the Covenant of the Goddess, a federation of more than one hundred covens.

Calabria himself (he died in December 1954 and was succeeded in the correspondence by Fr. Luigi Pedrollo). <p>Translator/editor Martin Moynihan calls these letters "limpid, fluent and deeply refreshing.

It is a Scottish form of Elizabeth, and is pronounced just like it's spelled, with the accent on the El. <p></p> <p>Elspeth was born in Hamilton, Scotland, near Glasgow. She moved with her parents to Canada were she spent her early years. But most of Elspeth's life has been spent near Lake Michigan. </p> <p>Elspeth received her Master of Arts in Teaching from Oakland University, a B.A. in English at Trinity College, Illinois; and General Bible at Moody Bible Institute. She has taught in the elementary grades; and written and edited curriculum. She now writes full- time. She is a member of the Authors Guild. </p> <p>Elspeth has been a familiar name in Christian publishing for over 15 years, with more than seventy-five books to her credit and sales reaching five million worldwide. She is the author of the bestselling series <i>David and I Talk to God</i> and <i>The Kids From Apple</i> <i>Street Church</i>, as well as the l990 Gold Medallion winner <i>Do You Se Me, God</i>?</p> <p> </p> <p>Elspeth loves to write. Most of her work has been for young children, from babies through about fifth graders. She's particularly interested in writing "first chapter books" for kids in the middle grades who are beyond picture books and easy-to-reads, but not quite ready to tackle longer novels. Mysteries were Elspeth's favorite kind of book when she was a kid herself, and they still are. She says it's fun to try to figure things out. In fact, planning and writing a book as a little like solving a mystery-getting a little bit of information here, a little bit there, and putting it all together. </p> <p>Elspeth enjoys every minute she spends with the three detective-cousins, Timothy, Titus, and Sarah-Jane featured in her series THE THREE COUSINS DETECTIVE CLUB.</p> <p>Elspeth and her husband, Michael, live in Illinois. From her home-office window, Elspeth can see a school on one side and a zoo on the other. She says it's fun to go to sleep at night, hearing the roar of the lions over the roar of the buses. </p> size : 5.2 x 7.5A Family Riddle The way Sarah-Jane Cooper saw it, there was good-boring and bad-boring. <p>Bad-boring was when you got stuck doing something you didn&#x2019;t want to do. </p><p>Good-boring was when you had all the time in the world, but there was nothing you had to do. You could make plans if you wanted to. But you didn&#x2019;t have to. </p><p>If all you wanted to do was to lie on the grass and look up at the clouds, that was OK. In fact, this was one of Sarah-Jane&#x2019;s favorite things to do. She especially loved it when the clouds looked like angels. It always reminded her of a nursery rhyme her grandmother had taught her: </p><p>Grasp the clouds by will or chance, </p><p>And you shall see the angels dance. </p><p>Sarah-Jane loved the sound of that, but she had no idea what it meant. How could anyone grasp the clouds? Even if you could reach them, how could you hold on to them? And even if you could&#x2014;why would that let you see dancing angels? It didn&#x2019;t make sense. </p><p>Sarah-Jane and her cousins Timothy Dawson and Titus McKay had once asked their grandmother what it meant. But all she knew was that she had learned it from her grandmother. </p><p>Grandma said the rhyme might be just pretty-sounding words that didn&#x2019;t mean anything. Or it could be a family riddle that would never be solved. </p><p>The cousins didn&#x2019;t like the idea of a riddle that would never be solved. They liked solving mysteries and finding things out. That&#x2019;s why they had a club called the Three Cousins Detective Club. </p><p>Sarah-Jane lay awake in the little bed in her grandmother&#x2019;s sewing room. Just taking her time getting up. Good-boring was waking up at your grandparents&#x2019; house on a beautiful summer morning&#x2014;the first day of your vacation there. Timothy and Titus were there, too. Timothy&#x2019;s baby sister, Priscilla, was too young to be away from her parents. But Titus had brought his Yorkshire terrier, Gubbio. Gubbio had never been there before and was very excited about having &#x201c;grandparents&#x201d; to spoil him. </p><p>The cousins&#x2019; mothers, who were sisters, had told them a thousand times to be good and not to wear out Grandma&#x2019;s patience. </p><p>The cousins&#x2019; grandmother, who was one of the most patient people in the world, had just laughed and said they&#x2019;d be fine. </p><p>Sarah-Jane felt so grown-up and happy that she sang &#x201c;Oh, What a Beautiful Morning&#x201d; to herself as she got dressed. </p><p>On such a beautiful morning, what could possibly go wrong?</p></p><h2>Black Shirt: Sir Oswald Mosley and British Fascism</h2><p>Hated and adored, trusted and feared, respected and scorned &#x2013; public opinion has never been indifferent to Sir Oswald Mosley. A brilliant politician, Mosley turned his back on conventional party politics to found, in 1932, the British Union of Fascists.Over the intervening years until now, many have worked hard to guard Mosley&#x2019;s reputation but Blackshirt casts new light on the man. The author reveals the true nature of Mosley's relationship with the Nazis, and challenges the prevailing view of Mosley&#x2019;s descent into anti-Semitism. With ground-breaking research and extensive use of archive material Dorril uncovers a bizarre set of characters and behind-the-scenes friends and colleagues who supported Mosley &#x2013; the crooks, swindlers, political and royal figures, secret agents, Nazi spies, lovers and &#x2018;crackpots&#x2019;. Blackshirt is an important and controversial new biography that overturns many of the accepted ideas about Oswald Mosley and British Fascism.</p><p>Stephen Dorril is a widely respected authority on the security and intelligence services. He has written several books on intelligence and contemporary history, most recently MI6, covering the last fifty years of special operations.

But our thinking on the subject has a long history, one that cultural critic Mithu Sanyal elegantly reconstructs. She narrates a history spanning from Lucretia&#x2014;whose legendary rape and suicide was said to be the downfall of the last Roman king&#x2014;to second-wave feminism, Tarzan, and Roman Polanski.<br><p>Sanyal demonstrates that the way we understand rape is remarkably (and alarmingly) consistent across the ages, even though the world has changed beyond recognition. It is high time for a new and informed debate about sexual violence, sexual boundaries, and consent.<br><br> Mithu Sanyal shows that our comprehension of rape is closely connected to our understanding of sex, sexuality, and gender. Why is it that we expect victims to be irreparably damaged? When we think of rapists, why do we think of strangers rather than uncles, husbands, priests, or boyfriends? And in the era of #MeToo, what should &#x201c;justice&#x201d; look like?<br><br> <i>Rape: From Lucretia to #MeToo</i> examines the role of race and the recurrent image of the black rapist, the omission of male victims, and what we mean when we talk about &#x201c;rape culture.&#x201d; Sanyal takes on every received opinion we have about rape, arguing with liberals, conservatives, and feminists alike.</p></p><p><b>Mithu Sanyal</b> is an award-winning broadcaster, academic and author. Her first book, <i>Vulva</i>, was translated into five languages.&#x201c;An essential book for our times by a writer at the height of her powers. Gripping, informed and accessible, this will be an instant feminist classic.&#x201d; <br><b>&#x2014;Laurie Penny, author of <i>Unspeakable Things</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;This is a book for today. Mithu Sanyal is insightful, thoughtful, and provocative. She encourages us to think about sexual violence in new ways and, most importantly, has challenging things to suggest about the way we should deal with rapists. A &#x2018;must read&#x2019; for anyone curious about sex and sexual harms.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Joanna Bourke, author of&nbsp;</b><i><b>Rape: A History from 1860 to the Present<br><br></b></i>&#x201c;The shockingly mundane debate over #MeToo has met its match in Mithu Sanyal. In her elegant, crisply written book, she peeks into the dark crannies we want to avoid. Joining her on this journey is the only way to understand the origins and context of the current problem.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2014;Vanessa Grigoriadis, author of&nbsp;<i><i>Blurred Lines: Rethinking Sex, Power, and Consent on Campus<br><br></i></i></b>&#x201c;If our culture is going to change, we need books like&nbsp;<i>Rape</i>. Mithu Sanyal is able to see past salacious scandal, simplified narratives of who rapes and why, and the usual carceral feminist response to sexual harm. As vexing as it is thoughtful, Sanyal produces original thought on a subject that is pontificated over more often than understood. It feels instantly essential.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Jessa Crispin, author of&nbsp;<i>Why I Am Not A Feminist: A Feminist Manifesto</i></b> <br><br>&#x201c;Offers a refreshing perspective on how and what feminists should prioritise.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;<i>Australian Book Review</i></b></p><h2>How Good Is Your Chess?: Rate Your Skill and Improve Your Strategy by Participating in 35 Master Games</h2><p>How good is your chess?

She was inspired to write her first book, <i>Dot to Dot in the Sky: Stories in the Stars</i>, when she wasn't able to find a book for her children that combined storytelling and astronomy. Joan has a diploma in Biological Sciences and Ecology from the Northern Alberta Institute. She lives near Edmonton with her three children. </p>Grade 4-7-Combining classical mythology and astronomy, this slim volume introduces novice stargazers to the night sky. The book begins with a brief introduction to why groups of stars became identified with pictures and what equipment beginners need in order to see them. Then 15 of the most common of the "official" 88 constellations are discussed. Each chapter begins with an illustration of the constellation and its major stars. After identifying the season for best viewing it, its origin(s), usually mythological, is told in story form. A "Where Is It?" feature describes how to find the pattern and what major stars to locate in order to "connect the dots." Aside from the myths, the most interesting and informative sections of each chapter are the "Space Notes," highlighted in dark blue, and "A Closer Look," highlighted in light purple. While both sections give important general and specific astronomical data, "A Closer Look" concentrates more on the stars within the constellation. The illustrations, especially, will catch the eye of younger children. A "Checklist of Constellations" and a star map are helpful for summarizing and putting the information into perspective. Students may well develop a lifelong interest in astronomy from reading books such as this.<br><i>Linda Wadleigh, Oconee County Middle School, Watkinsville, GA</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American Higher Education since World War II: A History (The William G. Bowen Series, 125)</h2><p><p><b>A masterful history of the postwar transformation of American higher education</b></p><p>American higher education is nearly four centuries old. But in the decades after World War II, as government and social support surged and enrollments exploded, the role of colleges and universities in American society changed dramatically. Roger Geiger provides the most complete and in-depth history of this remarkable transformation, taking readers from the GI Bill and the postwar expansion of higher education to the social upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s, desegregation and coeducation, and the challenges confronting American colleges today.</p><p>Shedding critical light on the tensions and triumphs of an era of rapid change, Geiger shows how American universities emerged after the war as the world&#x2019;s most successful system for the advancement of knowledge, how the pioneering of mass higher education led to the goal of higher education for all, and how the &#x201c;selectivity sweepstakes&#x201d; for admission to the most elite schools has resulted in increased stratification today. He identifies 1980 as a turning point when the link between research and economic development stimulated a revival in academic research&#x2015;and the ascendancy of the modern research university&#x2015;that continues to the present.</p><p>Sweeping in scope and richly insightful, this groundbreaking book demonstrates how growth has been the defining feature of modern higher education, but how each generation since the war has pursued it for different reasons. It provides the context we need to understand the complex issues facing our colleges and universities today, from rising inequality and skyrocketing costs to deficiencies in student preparedness and lax educational standards.</p></p><p>The definitive account of a transformative period in the history of American higher education, when the U.S. system of colleges and universities became what it is today.<b>Roger L.

Evolution! </em> </b></p><p><b>&#x2015;debra lynne katz</b></p><b> <p>Many people would love to experience clairvoyant visions that contain useful information for themselves and others, but they haven&#x2019;t got the foggiest idea how to initiate or control this process. Some believe the only way to do so is to put themselves through extreme circumstances, such as fasting for long periods, banishing themselves into harsh wilderness conditions, taking hallucinogenic drugs, or paying thousands of dollars for remote viewing or lengthy and costly clairvoyant or remote-viewing training programs. </p><p>While long-term, in-depth, and in-person training is a path I fully endorse and is the path that led to the writing of this book, countless readers of my first book, <em>You Are Psychic</em>, have demonstrated that such training is not necessary to access and utilize one&#x2019;s clairvoyance. In fact, during a recent expo in Los Angeles at which I conducted a clairvoyant training demonstration, I taught a group of sixty-five people how to perform a clairvoyant reading in less than forty-five minutes, something even I was not sure would be possible in such a short period of time.</p> <p>Out of the twelve or so volunteers I called up to the front of the room, four were &#x201c;seeing&#x201d; almost the exact same images within minutes. Even though the woman they were practicing on stated nothing more than her name, they each saw her standing before a microphone singing passionately. A few others saw her with suitcases and sipping drinks on a beach in what appeared to be or felt like a resort in Mexico. The woman confirmed she was leaving that night to go perform at a resort in Cancun.</p> <p>The mood changed drastically as another volunteer offered herself up to be &#x201c;read.&#x201d; Even before I finished leading them through the opening exercise, four or five of the readers had tears in their eyes, while one actually burst out in sobs. At this point they had no idea why they were having this kind of emotional reaction. However, soon a few more novice readers began receiving images and clairaudient messages indicating that this woman was grieving the death of someone close to her. She later confirmed that several of her family members had died very recently, including a parent. I wasn&#x2019;t surprised to discover that the reader who had the strongest initial emotional reaction had recently lost a parent herself. This is an example of clairsentience, the psychic ability of feeling others&#x2019; emotions and physical sensations. This ability naturally emerges when utilizing one&#x2019;s clairvoyance.</p> <p><b>What Exactly Is Clairvoyant Reading? </b></p><p><b>Clairvoyant reading is a very intensive form of meditation in which you focus on some simple visualizations, pose questions to these visualizations, and then wait patiently for the information to arrive. This information can be about anyone or anything. The only way it can work is through complete inward focus and concentration. But wait, don&#x2019;t let that scare you! When you know the right techniques to use, which you will soon, this intense concentration will be effortless. Why? Because when you are doing clairvoyant readings, you are not <em>trying </em>to quiet and empty a mind that by nature is addicted to being busy and noisy. Instead, your mind is so active with the techniques that the end result is you are focusing without <em>trying </em>to focus. This is particularly true when you are doing a reading on someone else, which is a lot easier than reading yourself. </b></p><p><b>When you see visions or use your clairvoyance, and you take the time to communicate the information to someone else, this is called a <em>reading</em>. When we &#x201c;read&#x201d; other people we can see into any aspect of their lives. The information comes from a variety of sources. Some of it comes from what I&#x2019;d call a universal source of all knowingness. Very little is known about this source except that it&#x2019;s there to tap into it whenever we like. This source is the same one that I believe Carl Jung was referring to when he coined the term <em>collective unconscious</em>. The information contained within this source is largely or perhaps entirely of a visual nature. Because the information exists in the form of pictures and archetypal images, it can be accessed by people of every nation, regardless of their verbal language or ability to use verbal language at all. We all interact with this source every night through our dreams. It&#x2019;s possible even animals can tap into this source, although I don&#x2019;t know that for sure.</b></p><b> <p><b>MEI Pictures/Filters/Programs </b></p><p><b>When we access information from this universal source, we cannot help but view it through own filters of perception. These filters are our own personal pictures made up of thoughtforms and feelings upon which our personalities and egos are based, and which very much determine how we approach life and all relationships, including those with others and with ourselves. In <em>You Are Psychic </em>I refer to these pictures or filters as Mental/Emotional Image pictures (MEI pictures). These filters are like minute programs running through our psyches. They are connected into particular parts of our bodies and energy fields and can even result in disease or physical pain. Sometimes they consist entirely of pain. They are like secret scripts that echo past traumatic experiences. Quite frequently these programs or scripts are written and passed on by those who raised us, or by our own selves to make sense of our past disappointments. We often carry these pictures or programs with us from other incarnations into our present one. They then act as shackles that keep us from expressing our true essence and experiencing greater freedom to be who we are or who we truly want to be in present time. </b></p><p><b>When we read other people who have something in common with us, who are strong mirrors for us, not only do we become more aware of these pictures or filters, but energetically they actually begin to shift and fall away, regardless of whether we can identify them at the time. In this way, performing a clairvoyant reading or healing on another person can be a powerful method of self-transformation because it allows us to deprogram ourselves so we are freer to be our own true selves in the present moment. This is really what all transpersonal and psychological modalities attempt to do, but clairvoyant reading can do it much faster. As a clairvoyant reader aware of this process, we can be our own therapist. Our clients are our mirrors and the impetus for change within ourselves. It&#x2019;s important to understand that this process occurs whether or not you think you have something in common with the person you are reading and really has nothing to do with your cognitive awareness, although the more readings you do, the more impressed you will be with the fact that you tend to read people who are in fact dealing with issues similar to those you are also dealing with in the present moment.</b></p><b> <p><b>Other Sources of Information </b></p><p><b>Apart from the universal source of knowingness, during a clairvoyant reading other sources of psychic information can be accessed to obtain information. These include telepathic communication from other living people, as well as deceased individuals and beings we call <em>spirit guides</em>, which behave as if their job is to help out with such matters. (As I will discuss in chapter 13, I&#x2019;ve never had an entity actually hand me a business card that identifies him literally as a &#x201c;spirit guide,&#x201d; but this term does correctly embody the intentions of a variety of beings available to assist us.) Sometimes as the clairvoyant, it will be you who is the source of the information as your spirit travels to a particular location to observe a lost object or incident that has occurred or that will occur at a specific point in time. </b></p><p><b>Readings can be done by letting the information come to you or by you going to the information, and you will be learning both these methods in the next few chapters. Much of the time when you seek information about a person, particularly one who has solicited your assistance and is sitting beside you or is talking to you on the telephone, you will discover the bulk of the information about that person&#x2019;s life resides in their aura, which is another word for the energy field that surrounds every living thing. An aura is a map of the body and a history book of the soul that accompanies that body. The first chapter of this historical epic begins long before the soul was thrust into this current lifetime; indeed, our auras contain information about all our incarnations&#x2015;past, present, and to some extent future (see chapter 7). Often, when a person asks a question about their health or a goal, a clairvoyant&#x2019;s attention will be drawn to a specific location within the aura. This is particularly true with health and relationship questions.</b></p><b> <p>Many times a readee will want to know why they are suffering from a particular ailment or what can be done about it. Often, in addition to receiving an answer about the readee&#x2019;s physical anatomy, an image will come up that indicates the person had a weakness in that area related to emotional trauma or neglect prior to the manifestation of the illness or problem. Carolyn Myss, in her book <em>Anatomy of the Spirit </em>and her excellent audiotape series <em>Why People Don&#x2019;t Heal </em>and <em>Three Levels of Power</em>, does a great job of explaining various ailments with their corresponding energy dynamics. My own readings with thousands of clients have led me to come up with similar connections. After practicing the techniques in the following chapters, you will likely begin to make similar observations.</p> <p><b>Foreign Energies </b></p><p><b>Our auras also contain a plethora of foreign energies that profoundly influence our physical, mental, and emotional health. These energies are derived from sources apart from ourselves, but they merge with us when they enter our field or when we enter the fields of others. Some of these foreign sources include family members, lovers, bosses, ancestors, spirits, and an assorted cast of other characters, with or without bodies. The type and amount of these energies that dwell within our auras and body at any given time largely determine how we feel and experience ourselves (self-esteem), and the ways in which we manifest on a creative level. </b></p><p><b>These energies influence our level of personal freedom and power, which obviously has an impact on our everyday life experiences such as finances, relationships, work, and on our overall development. Many clairvoyants have observed that these foreign energies travel back and forth through things that look like cords of electricity. These cords also sometimes show up in photographs. (I am currently working on a new book, which includes a collection of such photos taken by a close friend of mine, Kazandrah Martin, who is a healer and clairvoyant in Sedona, Arizona.) Sometimes, two people&#x2019;s energy fields are so merged together that they look like Siamese twins. This corresponds with the degree of codependency between the two. Most often I see this with an emotionally dependent parent and a child who has allowed that parent to feed off their energy system with the hope that someday the parent will change and give them what they were missing as children.</b></p><b> <p>A common image I encounter in my readings is that of my client standing in front of a mirror. Sometimes the client is smiling, sometimes frowning; there are often other faces and bodies standing around my client in the mirror. I&#x2019;ve discovered through corresponding symbols and intuitive information that this usually indicates the client is experiencing himself or herself through another&#x2019;s eyes and emotions. Now this might be terrific if the other person is a happy, encouraging, self-loving person who loves the client. But what if the &#x201c;other&#x201d; is picky and depressed, or filled with anxiety and self-loathing? Most of the time when I describe what I am seeing, the readee knows exactly who I am talking about, and verifies that their self-esteem and feelings of self-worth have been less than positive since being involved with this other person, or since this person began having problems in their own life.</p> <p>I have personally encountered dramatic shifts in my own self-perception and self-esteem&#x2015;particularly my satisfaction with my body and even my ability to lose weight&#x2015;after performing some self-healing techniques during which I released from my aura the foreign energy of someone I was dating. Some of these techniques are presented in chapter 3 and chapters 15 through 17. It doesn&#x2019;t matter how much you love your partner or your children or your clients. Their thoughts, feelings, and pain often do not serve you when they are in your body. It is like running the wrong fuel through your engine. It will clog things up, slow you down, burn you out, and even cause your immune system to break down.</p> <p>If you feel as if you are living a life that is not your own or if your job and the people around you don&#x2019;t make you feel good, most likely you are running other people&#x2019;s programs and energy through your body, which has caused you to make the choices that have led you to your current situation. As soon as you clear these out and get back in touch with your own life force, vibration, energy, path, whatever you want to call it, your life will begin to reshape itself to fit who you really are right now, in the present moment. This is what giving and receiving clairvoyant readings and healings can do for you.</p> <p><b>Seeing Is Not Just Seeing </b></p><p><b>After twelve years of experience as a clairvoyant reader and healer, I am thrilled to be discovering the extent of quality research that confirms many of my own personal observations and experiences. Some of the books that do a fantastic job describing this research are <em>Mind-Reach </em>by Russell Targ and Harold E. Puthoff; Dean Radin&#x2019;s <em>The Conscious Universe </em>and <em>Entangled Minds; </em>and Lynne McTaggart&#x2019;s <em>The Field </em>and <em>The Intention Experiment</em>. All these authors note that quantum physicists, in their early research, discovered that particles&#x2015;the building blocks of atoms, made up of electric charges, magnetic charges, and light&#x2015;changed as they were being observed, even when researchers were doing nothing more than looking at them. Long before I ever heard about the above-mentioned research, I would often be looking at someone&#x2019;s aura or some kind of energy, and I would notice that it immediately began shifting, even before I communicated what I was seeing to the readee. After alerting the readee to the energy I was seeing, I would many times see an even greater shift in that energy. </b></p><p><b>In <em>The Intention Experiment</em>, McTaggart makes a distinction between <em>attention </em>and <em>intention</em>. Attention is focusing on something without intent; intention is focus with a desired outcome. Likewise, <em>clairvoyant reading </em>is putting your attention on the target or object, while <em>clairvoyant healing </em>is reading with the intention to initiate a change. This intention can be general&#x2015;as when you approach a reading with the attitude that you are going to do your best to see and offer the most accurate information in order to help your readee achieve maximum health and happiness.

Lewis Cole is a professor of film at Columbia University in New York City.In this candid and absorbing memoir, Hilliard tells of his hardscrabble upbringing in Alabama and Oakland, Calif., his co-founding of the Black Panthers, the party's growth and struggles and, finally, his own battle against drug addiction. Writing with him, Cole ( The Dream Team ) evokes a compelling, vernacular first-person voice (even though much reconstructed dialogue is included) and uses interviews with Hilliard's friends and comrades to add depth and texture. Seeking a "calling" in his life and inspired by Malcolm X, Hilliard recalls how he joined friend Huey Newton to found the Panthers. He assesses Newton and Eldridge Cleaver, describes internal battles over ideology and strategy, gets arrested and concludes that educating the community is more important than battling the police. While the FBI wars with the Panthers, the Panthers' leaders split, and Hilliard goes to jail. Once free, Hilliard finds Oakland has lost revolutionary spirit, and he descends into crack addiction. He finally embraces the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous--but refuses to give up his "righteous indignation" about a society that still, he believes, needs change.

Summary; One of the greatest feats in Patrick Leigh Fermor&#39;s remarkable life was the kidnapping of General Kreipe, the German commander in Crete, on 26 April 1944. He and Captain Billy Moss hatched a daring plan to abduct the general, while ensuring that no reprisals were taken against the Cretan population. Dressed as German military police, they stopped and took control of Kreipe&#39;s car, drove through 22 German checkpoints, then succeeded in hiding from the German army before finally being picked up on a beach in the south of the island.

Following his walk across Europe, he lived and travelled in the Balkans and Greek Archipelago. He joined the Irish Guards and during the occupation of Crete led the party that captured the German commander. He was awarded the DSO and OBE and was once described by the BBC as &#39;a cross between Indiana Jones, James Bond and Graham Greene&#39;. Towards the end of his life he wrote the first two books about his early trans-European odyssey, A Time of Gifts and Between the Woods and the Water. He planned a third, unfinished at the time of his death in 2011, which has since been edited by Colin Thubron and Artemis Cooper and published as The Broken Road.A glorious first-hand account of one of the great adventures of the Second World War * Gentleman&#39;s Journal * Paddy&#39;s vividly idiomatic reports irresistibly take us in to the skulduggery and derring-do . . . a wonderful story * Jan Morris, Literary Review * What shines through in Leigh Fermor&#39;s account is his connection to and respect and admiration for the spirit of the Cretan people * Daily Mail * Abducting a General is filled with the same rich exuberant prose [as his trilogy] and fulfils its objective as portraying the Cretan people as the true heroes of the resistance * TLS * A riveting first-hand account * Good Book Guide * Paddy was the Byron of our time * Standpoint * Gripping buccaneering of the old school * Sun * The late, great Pagrick Leigh Fermor, described as a cross between Indiana Jones, James Bond and Graham Greene, first became famous in 1944 for his daring kidnap of high-ranking German general . . .

He interprets the psalms as scripture as well as in their character as songs, prayers, and poetry from Israel&#39;s history.

The explicit connections which McCann draws from the psalms to the New Testament and to Christian faith and life are extensive, making his work suitable for serious study of the psalms in academic and in church settings. An appendix examines the tradition of singing the psalms and offers suggestions for the use of the psalms in worship.</p><p>J.

It sounded as if a dozen express trains were about to hit the shed. I rolled over in my blanket, trying to get out of the way, and was aware of a blaze of orange, lighting up boxes and bits of old farm equipment and tackle. An ancient rusting tractor looked briefly like an overgrown insect.<br> <br>&#x201c;What was that, Laurie?&#x201d; Andy asked. I could see him sitting up, between me and the window.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Both light and sound faded and died. A dog started barking&#x2014;deep-throated, a Labrador maybe. I got up and walked to the window, banging my shin on something in the dark. It was dark outside, too, moon and stars hidden by cloud. A light came on in the farmhouse, which was a couple of hundred meters away, just below the ridge.<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not raining. What was it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t someone at the camp say something about an artillery range on the moor?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nowhere near here, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever they were firing could have gone astray.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rubbing my shin, I said, &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t sound like a shell. And a shell wouldn&#x2019;t produce fireworks like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A rocket, maybe.&#x201d; He yawned loudly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all quiet now, anyway. No sweat. Go to sleep. We&#x2019;ve a long trek in the morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>I stood by the window for a while. Eventually the light in the house went out: the farmer presumably took the same view as Andy. In the pitch black I felt my way to the pile of straw which served as a bed. This was less fun than it had seemed the previous evening; there was little protection from the hardness of the earth floor, and once awake I knew all about the aches in my muscles.<br> <br>Andy was already asleep. I blamed him for our being here&#x2014;for volunteering us into the orienteering expedition in the first place, and then for insisting on a left fork which had taken us miles out of our way. It had looked as though we would have to spend the night on the moor, but we&#x2019;d come across this isolated farm as dusk was thickening. The rules were not to ask for help, so we&#x2019;d settled down in the shed.<br> <br>I thought my aches, and resenting Andy, would keep me awake, but I was dead tired. We had set out early from summer camp, and it had been a long day&#x2019;s slog. Drifting into sleep again, I was half aware of another explosion, but it was a distant one, and I was too weary really to wake up&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t even be sure I wasn&#x2019;t dreaming.<br> <br>&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;&#x2022;<br> <br>Andy woke me with the gray light of dawn filtering in. He said, &#x201c;Listen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen!&#x201d;<br> <br>I struggled into wakefulness. The noise was coming from the direction of the farmhouse, but further away, a succession of loud thumpings, heavy and mechanical.<br> <br>&#x201c;Farm machinery?&#x201d; I suggested.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br> <br>Listening more carefully, I didn&#x2019;t either. The thumps came at intervals of a second or less, and they were getting nearer. There was even a sensation of the ground shaking under me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Something heading this way,&#x201d; Andy said. &#x201c;Something big, by the sound of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>We crowded together at the small window of the shed. The sun hadn&#x2019;t risen, but to the east the farmhouse was outlined against a pearly sky. Smoke from a chimney rose almost straight: farmers were early risers. It looked like a good day for the trek back to camp. Then I saw what was coming into view on the other side of the house.<br> <br>The top appeared first, an enormous gray-green hemispherical capsule, flat side down, which seemed to be floating ponderously in midair. But it wasn&#x2019;t floating: a weird stiltlike leg moved in a vast arc across the sky and planted itself just to the right of the farmhouse. As it crashed down a second leg appeared, passing over the house and landing between it and the shed. I could see a third leg, too, which if it followed suit would come to ground close to us, if not on top of us. But at that point, it stopped. The gigantic object, more than twenty meters high, stood straddling the house.<br> <br>A band of bright green glassy panels ran horizontally along the side of the capsule. It produced an effect that was a cross between multiple staring eyes and a grinning mouth. It wasn&#x2019;t a pleasant grin.<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s making a film.&#x201d; Andy&#x2019;s voice was unsteady. I turned to him and he looked as scared as I felt. &#x201c;That must be it. A science-fiction movie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So where are the cameras?&#x201d; I felt my voice was coming out wrong, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;They probably have to get it into position first.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know whether he believed it. I didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Something was moving beneath the capsule, curling and twisting and stretching out. It was like an elephant&#x2019;s trunk, or a snake, except that it was silvery and metallic. It corkscrewed down towards the roof of the house and brushed lightly against it. Then it moved to the chimney stack and grasped it with a curling tip. Bricks sprayed like confetti, and we heard them crashing onto the slates.<br> <br>I was shivering. Inside the house a woman screamed. A door at the back burst open, and a man in shirt and trousers came out. He stared up at the machine looming above him and started running. Immediately a second tentacle uncurled, this time fast and purposeful. The tip caught him before he&#x2019;d gone ten meters, fastened round his waist, and plucked him from the ground. He was screaming, too, now.<br> <br>The tentacle lifted him up in front of the row of panels, and his screams turned to muffled groaning. After a few moments the tentacle twisted back on itself. A lenslike opening appeared at the base of the capsule; it carried him towards it and thrust him through. I thought of someone holding a morsel of food on a fork before popping it into his mouth, and felt sick.<br> <br>His groans ended as the tentacle withdrew, and the opening closed. The woman in the house had also become quiet; but the silence was even more frightening. Resting on its spindly legs, the machine had the look of an insect digesting its prey. I remembered my glimpse of the derelict tractor in the night; this insect was as tall as King Kong.<br> <br>For what seemed a long time, nothing happened. The thing didn&#x2019;t stir, and there was no sound or movement from the house. All was still; not even a bird chirped. The tentacle hovered in midair, motionless and rigid.<br> <br>When, after a minute or so, the tentacle did move, it raised itself higher, as though making a salute. For a second or two it hung in the air, before slamming down violently against the roof. Slates scattered, and rafters showed through a gaping hole. The woman started to shriek again.<br> <br>Methodically the tentacle smashed the house, and as methodically picked over the ruins, like a scavenger going through a garbage can. The shrieking stopped, leaving just the din of demolition. A second tentacle set to work alongside the first, and a third joined them.<br> <br>They probed deep into the rubble, lifting things up to the level of the panels. Most of what was picked up was dropped or tossed aside&#x2014;chairs, a sideboard, a double bed, a bathtub dangling the metal pipes from which it had been ripped. A few were taken inside: I noticed an electric kettle and a television set.<br> <br>At last it was over, and dust settled as the tentacles retracted under the capsule.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think we ought to get away from here,&#x201d; Andy said. His voice was so low I could hardly hear him.<br> <br>&#x201c;How far do you think it can see?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. But if we dodge out quickly, and get round the back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>I gripped his arm. Something was moving at the base of the rubble that had been the farmhouse: a black dog wriggled free and started running across the farmyard. It covered about ten meters before a tentacle arrowed towards it. The dog was lifted, howling, in front of the panels, and held there. I thought it was going to be taken inside, as the man had been; instead the tentacle flicked it away. Briefly the dog was a black blur against the dawn light, then a crumpled silent heap.<br> <br>The sick feeling was back, and one of my legs was trembling. I thought of my first sight of the Eiffel Tower, the summer my mother left and Ilse came to live with us&#x2014;and my panicky feeling over the way it stretched so far up into the sky. This was as if the Eiffel Tower had moved&#x2014;had smashed a house to bits and swallowed up a man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tossed a dog to its death the way you might throw away an apple core.<br> <br>Time passed more draggingly than I ever remembered. I looked at my watch, and the display read 05:56. I looked again after what seemed like half an hour, and it said 05:58. The sky was getting lighter and there was first a point of gold, then a sliver, finally a disk of sun beyond the ruins of the house. I looked at my watch again. It was 06:07.<br> <br>Andy said, &#x201c;Look!&#x201d;<br> <br>The legs hadn&#x2019;t moved but the capsule was tilting upwards and beginning a slow rotation. The row of panels was moving to the left. Soon we might be out of the field of vision and have a chance of sneaking away. But as the rotation continued, a second row of panels came into view. It could see all round.<br> <br>When it had traversed a hundred and eighty degrees, the rotation stopped. After that, nothing happened. The monster just stayed there, fixed, as leaden minutes crawled by.<br> <br>The first plane came over soon after eight. A fighter made two runs, east to west and then west to east at a lower level. The thing didn&#x2019;t move. A quarter of an hour later a helicopter circled round, taking photographs, probably. It was nearly midday before the armored brigade arrived. Tanks and other tracked vehicles drew up on open farmland, and, in the bit of the farm lane in view, we could see an important-looking car and some trucks, including a TV van, all keeping a careful distance.<br> <br>After that, nothing happened for another long time. We learned later this was the period in which our side was attempting to make radio contact, trying different frequencies without result. Andy got impatient, and again suggested making a run for it, towards the tanks.<br> <br>I said, &#x201c;The fact it hasn&#x2019;t moved doesn&#x2019;t mean it won&#x2019;t. Remember the dog.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do. It might also decide to smash this hut.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And if we run, and it starts something and the army starts something back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we&#x2019;re likely to catch it from both sides.&#x201d;<br> <br>He reluctantly accepted that. &#x201c;Why hasn&#x2019;t the army done something?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think they ought to do?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, not just sit there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose they don&#x2019;t want to rush things.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>I broke off as an engine started up, followed by a rumble of tracks. We ran to the window. A single tank was moving forward. It had a pole attached to its turret, and a white flag fluttering from the pole.<br> <br>The tank lurched across the field and stopped almost directly beneath the capsule. The engine switched off, and I heard a sparrow chirruping outside the shed. Then, unexpectedly, there was a burst of classical music.<br> <br>I asked, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s that coming from?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;From the tank, I think.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe they want to demonstrate that we&#x2019;re civilized, not barbarians. It&#x2019;s that bit from a Beethoven symphony, isn&#x2019;t it&#x2014;the one that&#x2019;s sung as a European anthem?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Andy pointed. &#x201c;Look.&#x201d;<br> <br>The machine was showing signs of movement. Beneath the capsule a tentacle uncurled. It extended down towards the tank and began waving gently.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s it doing?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s keeping time.&#x201d;<br> <br>The weird thing was, he was right; it was moving in rhythm with the music. A second tentacle emerged, dipped, and brushed against the turret. As though it were getting the hang of things, the first tentacle started moving faster, in a more positive beat. The second felt its way round the tank from front to rear, then made a second approach from the side, moving over it and probing underneath. The tip dug down, rocking the tank slightly, and reemerged to complete an embrace. The tank rocked more violently as it was lifted, at first just clear of the ground, then sharply upward.<br> <br>Abruptly the music gave way to the stridence of machine-gun fire. Tracer bullets flamed against the sky. The tank rose in the tentacle&#x2019;s grip until it was level with the panels. It hung there, spitting out sparks.<br> <br>But pointlessly; at that angle the tracers were scouring empty sky. And they stopped abruptly, as the tentacle tightened its grip; armorplate crumpled like tinfoil. For two or three seconds it squeezed the tank, before uncurling and letting it drop. The tank fell like a stone, landing on its nose and balancing for an instant before toppling over. There was a furrow along the side where it had been compressed to less than half its original width.<br> <br>Andy said, &#x201c;That was a Challenger.&#x201d; He sounded shaken, but not as shaken as I felt. I could still see that terrible careless squeeze, the tank dropped like a toffee paper.<br> <br>When I looked out again, one of the tentacles had retracted, but the other was waving still, and still in the rhythm it had picked up from the music. I wanted to run&#x2014;somewhere, anywhere, not caring what came next&#x2014;but I couldn&#x2019;t move a muscle. I wondered if anyone in the tank had survived. I didn&#x2019;t see how they could have.<br> <br>Then, unexpectedly and shatteringly, there was a roar of aircraft as the fighter-bombers, which had been on standby, whooshed in from the south, launching rockets as they came. Of the six they fired, two scored hits. I saw the long spindly legs shatter, the capsule tilt and sway and crash. It landed between the ruins of the farmhouse and the wrecked tank, with an impact that shook the shed.<br> <br>I could hardly believe how quickly it was over&#x2014;and how completely. But there was the capsule lying on its side, with broken bits of leg sticking out. As we stared, a second wave of fighter-bombers swooped in, pulverizing the remains.</p><h2>The Awful End of Prince William the Silent: The First Assassination of a Head of State with a Handgun (Making History)</h2><p><p>In this innovative and engaging work of history, distinguished author Lisa Jardine shows how the first killing by handgun of a head of state had a profound effect on the course of history. The shooting of Prince William of Orange by a French Catholic in 1584 had immediate political consequences: it was a serious setback for the Protestant cause in the Netherlands, as its forces fought for independence from the Catholic rule of the Hapsburg Empire. But, as Jardine brilliantly demonstrates, its implications for those in positions of power were even more far-reaching, as the assassination heralded the arrival of a lethal new threat to the security of nations -- a pistol that could be concealed on one's person and used to deadly means at point-blank range.</p><p>Queen Elizabeth I, William's close Protestant ally, was devastated by his death and, as the object of assassination plots herself, was thrown into panic. The English parliament soon enacted legislation making it an offense to bring a pistol anywhere near a royal palace. Elizabeth's terror was not misplaced.As Jardine observes, William's assassination was the first in a long and bloody line that would include the murders of President Lincoln in 1865 and Archduke Ferdinand in 1914 -- a terror that is all too relevant today.</p></p><p><p>Lisa Jardine, Commander of the Order of the British Empire, is the director of the Centre for Editing Lives and Letters, the centenary professor of Renaissance Studies at Queen Mary, University of London, and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society. She lives with her husband and three children in London.</p>William the Silent may be an obscure name for many readers, but his assassination in 1584, at close range with a handgun, is still remembered in the Netherlands as a key event in the long Dutch struggle for independence from Spain. Born to a German family, William inherited a French principality and was raised under the tutelage of the Catholic Emperor Charles V, yet became the "father" of Netherlands Protestant national identity. Jardine (<i>The Curious Life of Robert Hooke</i>) places the assassination within the era's religious turmoil and espionage systems, arguing for its deep repercussions for security, diplomacy and warfare. Her scholarship is broad, as she dissects William's lasting reputation for tolerance as a product of the writings of his supporters and traces the technology, uses and symbolism of the wheel-lock pistol used to kill him. With modern references including 9/11, fatwahs and Tupac Shakur, Jardine demonstrates the pervasiveness of the issues raised both by this type of weapon and by responses to crimes of state. Some readers might wish for a more narrative approach to such a potentially riveting story, but they will enjoy this marvelous study of a single event and its numerous echoes. <i>(Feb. 7)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It wasn&#x2019;t unusual any more, having a pint with his father. In the early evening, before he went home after work. He&#x2019;d phone, or his da would phone. It wasn&#x2019;t an organised, regular thing.</p><p>It had started the day his da got his first mobile. His first call was to Jimmy.</p><p>&#x2014;How&#x2019;s it goin&#x2019;?</p><p>&#x2014;Da?</p><p>&#x2014;Yeah, me.</p><p>&#x2014;How are yeh?</p><p>&#x2014;Not too bad. I&#x2019;m after gettin&#x2019; one o&#x2019; the mobiles.</p><p>&#x2014;Great.</p><p>&#x2014;I&#x2019;m usin&#x2019; it now, like.</p><p>&#x2014;Congratulations.</p><p>&#x2014;Will we go for a pint? To celebrate.</p><p>&#x2014;Grand. Good. Yeah.</p><p>Jimmy&#x2019;s da had still been working when he got the phone. But he&#x2019;d retired a while back.</p><p>&#x2014;There&#x2019;s fuck-all work, he&#x2019;d told everyone when he&#x2019;d made the announcement on Stephen&#x2019;s Day, when Jimmy had dragged the kids to his parents&#x2019; house to collect the presents and kiss their granny.&#x2014;So I might as well just stop an&#x2019; call it retirement.</p><p>Jimmy&#x2019;s own job was safe &#x2013; he thought.</p><p>&#x2014;Well, said his da now in the pub.&#x2014;Facebook. Yeh know it, yeah?</p><p>&#x2014;I do, yeah, said Jimmy.</p><p>&#x2014;What d&#x2019;you make of it?</p><p>&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know.</p><p>&#x2014;Yeh don&#x2019;t know?</p><p>&#x2014;No, said Jimmy.&#x2014;Not really.</p><p>&#x2014;But you&#x2019;ve kids.</p><p>&#x2014;I know tha&#x2019;, said Jimmy.&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve four of them.</p><p>&#x2014;Is it the four you have? said his da.&#x2014;I thought it was three.</p><p>&#x2014;No, said Jimmy.&#x2014;It&#x2019;s been four for a good while. Ten years, like.</p><p>This was what Jimmy liked. It was why he phoned his da every couple of weeks. His da was messing, pretending he didn&#x2019;t know how many grandchildren he had. It was the way he&#x2019;d always been. A pain in the hole at times but, today, exactly what Jimmy wanted.</p><p>&#x2014;It&#x2019;s Darren has the three, is it? said his da.</p><p>His name was Jimmy as well.</p><p>&#x2014;No, said Jimmy, the son.&#x2014;Darren has two. Far as I know.</p><p>Darren was one of Jimmy&#x2019;s brothers.</p><p>&#x2014;Ah now, yeh see but, said Jimmy Sr.&#x2014;I knew there was somethin&#x2019;.</p><p>He put his pint down.</p><p>&#x2014;She&#x2019;s pregnant.</p><p>Fuck, thought Jimmy. Fuck fuck fuck it.</p><p>&#x2014;Is she? he said.&#x2014;That&#x2019;s brilliant.</p><p>&#x2014;Yeah, said Jimmy Sr.&#x2014;Darren phoned your mother this mornin&#x2019; to tell her. She&#x2019;s three months gone.</p><p>&#x2014;Ma is?</p><p>&#x2014;Fuck off. Melanie.</p><p>Melanie was Darren&#x2019;s wife &#x2013; although they&#x2019;d never got married. His fuckin&#x2019;&nbsp;life&nbsp;partner. They&#x2019;d been trying for another baby for years. There&#x2019;d been so many miscarriages, it had become a rule between Jimmy and his da: no more jokes about Melanie&#x2019;s miscarriages. Their other two kids &#x2014;</p><p>&#x2014;The two that managed to hang on in there.</p><p>They&#x2019;d broken the rule once or twice.</p><p>The other two kids were twelve and ten.</p><p>&#x2014;She&#x2019;s well on her way so, Jimmy said now.</p><p>&#x2014;Yeah, said his da.&#x2014;Fingers crossed.</p><p>He sniffed the top of his pint.</p><p>&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t think I could cope with another miscarriage, he said.</p><p>He drank.</p><p>&#x2014;Anyway, he said.&#x2014;Facebook.</p><p>&#x2014;Yeah.</p><p>&#x2014;What is it? Exactly.</p><p>&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know much about it, said Jimmy.</p><p>His da had a laptop at home. He knew how to google. He&#x2019;d booked flights online. He&#x2019;d backed a few horses, although he preferred the walk to the bookie&#x2019;s. He&#x2019;d bought a second-hand book online, about Dublin during the War of Independence. He&#x2019;d nearly bought an apartment in Turkey but that had been a bit of an accident. He&#x2019;d thought he was clicking to see inside the place&#x2013; a tour &#x2013; but he&#x2019;d stopped when the laptop asked him for his credit card details. He knew he&#x2019;d gone wrong or it was a scam. But the point was, his da knew his way around the internet. So Jimmy didn&#x2019;t know why he was pretending to be completely thick.</p><p>&#x2014;Why d&#x2019;yeh want to know? he asked.</p><p>&#x2014;Ah, for fuck sake, said his da.&#x2014;Every time I ask a fuckin&#x2019; question.</p><p>&#x2014;What&#x2019;s wrong with yeh?</p><p>&#x2014;I ask a fuckin&#x2019; question and some cunt says why d&#x2019;yeh want to know.</p><p>&#x2014;You&#x2019;re askin&#x2019; the wrong cunts, said Jimmy.</p><p>&#x2014;Must be.</p><p>&#x2014;Wha&#x2019; questions?</p><p>&#x2014;Wha&#x2019;?</p><p>&#x2014;What questions have yeh been askin&#x2019;?</p><p>&#x2014;Well, said his da.&#x2014;I asked a fella in Woodie&#x2019;s where the duck-tape was. An&#x2019;, granted, he didn&#x2019;t say why d&#x2019;yeh want to know. He said, wha&#x2019; d&#x2019;yeh want it for. I told him I wanted to fuckin&#x2019; buy it.</p><p>&#x2014;He just wanted to help.</p><p>&#x2014;That&#x2019;s not the fuckin&#x2019; point. There was a time when he&#x2019;d have just said, over there or I haven&#x2019;t a clue. He wouldn&#x2019;t have asked me why I wanted it. That&#x2019;s the problem. Somehow or other he&#x2019;s become an expert on duck-tape. The shops are full of experts. The country&#x2019;s full of fuckin&#x2019; experts. Tha&#x2019; haven&#x2019;t a fuckin&#x2019; clue.</p><p>&#x2014;Facebook.</p><p>&#x2014;Yeah.</p><p>&#x2014;It&#x2019;s a social network.</p><p>&#x2014;What&#x2019;s tha&#x2019;?</p><p>&#x2014;How come every time I say somethin&#x2019; some cunt asks me a question?</p><p>&#x2014;Tou-fuckin&#x2019;-shay, said Jimmy Sr.</p><p>&#x2014;Listen, said Jimmy.&#x2014;Your phone there. Your mobile.</p><p>&#x2014;Yeah.</p><p>&#x2014;Your contacts. Your friends an&#x2019; their numbers. Your kids. All the numbers yeh&#x2019;d want.

But that&#x2019;s the start. The foundation of it, I suppose. Friends. You&#x2019;re going for a pint, d&#x2019;yeh phone the lads to see if they&#x2019;re goin&#x2019;?</p><p>&#x2014;No point, said Jimmy Sr.&#x2014;I know the answer.</p><p>&#x2014;Just go with me on this one, Da, said Jimmy.&#x2014;I&#x2019;m tryin&#x2019; to educate yeh.</p><p>&#x2014;Go on.</p><p>&#x2014;You&#x2019;re goin&#x2019; for a pint, like.

He took his reading glasses out of his shirt pocket, put them on and stared at it again.</p><p>&#x2014;Your mother, he said.&#x2014;She wants milk.</p><p>He put the phone down and took off his glasses.</p><p>&#x2014;She used to be able to walk to the shops herself, he said.</p><p>&#x2014;She was very good at it.</p><p>&#x2014;He texts yeh back, said Jimmy.&#x2014;Yeah, or somethin&#x2019;. An&#x2019; you text him. Grand.</p><p>&#x2014;That&#x2019;s righ&#x2019;, said Jimmy Sr.&#x2014;Tha&#x2019; sounds like a day in my life.</p><p>&#x2014;Well, that&#x2019;s social networkin&#x2019;, said Jimmy.&#x2014;More or less.

He knew Jimmy wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x2014;Why did yeh ask abou&#x2019; Facebook?</p><p>&#x2014;Somethin&#x2019; Bertie told me, said Jimmy Sr.&#x2014;Somethin&#x2019; he heard.</p><p>&#x2014;It&#x2019;s illegal if it&#x2019;s Bertie.</p><p>&#x2014;No, said Jimmy Sr.&#x2014;It&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s fuckin&#x2019; immoral but.</p><p>&#x2014;You&#x2019;ll have to tell me now.</p><p>&#x2014;I&#x2019;m goin&#x2019; to tell yeh. I&#x2019;ve every intention of tellin&#x2019; yeh.

It&#x2019;s like everythin&#x2019; else.</p><p>Jimmy knew what his da meant and it was a good place to give him his own news. But he couldn&#x2019;t do it. He wasn&#x2019;t ready.</p><p>&#x2014;Bertie, he said.</p><p>&#x2014;Fuckin&#x2019; Bertie, said his da.&#x2014;He told me his youngest fella, Gary I think it is. He&#x2019;s about the same age as your Marvin.</p><p>&#x2014;Seventeen.</p><p>&#x2014;Abou&#x2019; tha&#x2019;, yeah. A year or two older. A little fucker, by all accounts.

So it&#x2019;s a strange thing to be tellin&#x2019; yeh an&#x2019; it isn&#x2019;t even dark outside. I wouldn&#x2019;t have told yeh twenty years ago. I wouldn&#x2019;t&#x2019;ve dreamt of it.

An&#x2019; there&#x2019;s a lot more of your forehead on view than there used to be. Happens to us all. It&#x2019;s desperate. Men are hit particularly bad. So, but. It isn&#x2019;t all bad, is what I&#x2019;m tryin&#x2019; to say. Father to son, like.</p><p>&#x2014;D&#x2019;you know wha&#x2019;, Father?</p><p>&#x2014;Wha&#x2019;?</p><p>&#x2014;That&#x2019;s the first time you&#x2019;ve ever spoken to me like tha&#x2019;.

That&#x2019;s a different conversation. An&#x2019; I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s one we&#x2019;ll ever be havin&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x2014;Grand, said Jimmy.</p><p>They said nothing for a bit.</p><p>&#x2014;How come Bertie has such a young son? Jimmy asked.</p><p>&#x2014;Ah Jaysis, said Jimmy Sr.&#x2014;He rode his missis. It&#x2019;s no great mystery.</p><p>&#x2014;Still though, said Jimmy.&#x2014;He&#x2019;s quite old to be havin&#x2019; a teenager for a son.</p><p>He watched his father shrug. One of the shoulders was slower coming back down than the other and he seemed to be in a bit of pain as the second shoulder settled.</p><p>&#x2014;Bertie&#x2019;d be a bit younger than me, said Jimmy Sr.</p><p>&#x2014;Not that much, said Jimmy.&#x2014;One of his kids, the mad one. Jason. He was a year behind me in school. He must be forty-five or six now.</p><p>&#x2014;He must be, said Jimmy Sr.</p><p>&#x2014;Where is he these days?</p><p>&#x2014;Over there, said Jimmy Sr.</p><p>&#x2014;The fat guy in the Arsenal jersey?</p><p>&#x2014;That&#x2019;s him, said Jimmy Sr.&#x2014;He&#x2019;s let himself go since he came off the heroin. Still lives at home.</p><p>&#x2014;Hate tha&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x2014;Don&#x2019;t be talkin&#x2019;. It&#x2019;s not natural. The state of him. Bertie says he has an Arsenal duvet cover an&#x2019; all.</p><p>&#x2014;They&#x2019;re not a bad team.</p><p>&#x2014;They&#x2019;re overrated. Ah, it&#x2019;s sad. He did time, yeh know.</p><p>&#x2014;Portlaoise.</p><p>&#x2014;That&#x2019;s righ&#x2019;. Gun but no bullets. Still, he had the gun. Walks into a credit union with it. So, fuck&#x2019;m. He deserved what he got. But annyway.</p><p>He picked up his pint. There was about half of it left.</p><p>&#x2014;Hang on, said Jimmy.</p><p>He went up to the bar to order another pint for his da. He wanted to stand, just for a bit. He was restless, angry. Not really angry &#x2013; nervous.</p><p>He looked at Bertie&#x2019;s Jason. He didn&#x2019;t look like a man to be scared of, a man who&#x2019;d done time for armed robbery. He was sitting beside two other guys &#x2013; now they looked a bit frightening &#x2013; but he wasn&#x2019;t really with them. They were much younger than Jason, harder, firmer, shouting quietly at each other.</p><p>&#x2014;Fuckin&#x2019; did.</p><p>&#x2014;Fuckin&#x2019; didn&#x2019;t, fuck off, m&#x2019;n.</p><p>He waited for the pint and paid for it. He took the change.</p><p>&#x2014;Thanks.</p><p>And he went back down to his da.</p><p>&#x2014;There yeh go.</p><p>&#x2014;Good man, said Jimmy Sr.</p><p>He put the empty glass on the table to his left, and put the new one on top of his beer mat.</p><p>&#x2014;So. Young Jason.</p><p>&#x2014;Yeah.</p><p>&#x2014;He gets out. But the family&#x2019;s gone.</p><p>&#x2014;Where?</p><p>&#x2014;No, not gone anywhere. Just not his anymore. She doesn&#x2019;t want annythin&#x2019; to do with him. A lovely bird, by the way. You&#x2019;d never guess it, looking at George fuckin&#x2019; Clooney over there in his Arsenal gear. Fuckin&#x2019; lovely.</p><p>&#x2014;Kids?</p><p>&#x2014;Two. I think. They don&#x2019;t want to know him either. She did a great job while he was away. I&#x2019;m not bein&#x2019; sarcastic. She did a great fuckin&#x2019; job. Bertie&#x2019;ll tell yeh himself.</p><p>&#x2014;Yeh fancy her.</p><p>&#x2014;I do, yeah, said Jimmy Sr.&#x2014;Absolutely. I walk past her house every day. I sit on her wall.</p><p>Jimmy laughed.</p><p>&#x2014;She&#x2019;s gorgeous, said his father.&#x2014;An&#x2019; she has the two kids, boy an&#x2019; a girl, one of them in Trinity College doin&#x2019; law for fuck sake, and the other one in London, workin&#x2019; in a bank that actually lends money. An&#x2019; that makes her even more gorgeous.</p><p>He picked up his pint and knocked back about half it.</p><p>&#x2014;So Bertie an&#x2019; his missis are lumped with poor Jason.</p><p>&#x2014;Jesus.</p><p>&#x2014;Yeah, said Jimmy&#x2019;s da.&#x2014;It&#x2019;s rough.</p><p>They looked across at Jason.</p><p>&#x2014;It&#x2019;s not the fact tha&#x2019; he&#x2019;s there in the house, said Jimmy&#x2019;s da.&#x2014;That&#x2019;s not too bad. There&#x2019;s only him an&#x2019; the young lad, the Facebook fella. The rest are gone, so there&#x2019;s plenty o&#x2019; room. It&#x2019;s not that. It&#x2019;s more the fact of him.

Now a member of Magnum, the prestigious photojournalist's cooperative, he is known for his unflinching coverage of events both large and small. Here we see tender moments between parents and children contrasted with the Los Angeles riots. The joy of a wedding follows the sorrow and anger at the funeral of Yusef Hawkins in Brooklyn. The deceptive innocence of rural life balances the tensions of the urban drug scene. And a 104-year-old woman contemplates her life a few pages away from the Million Man March in Washington, D.C. There is truth in Reed's work, as well as anger, and compassion. These images communicate to us--sometimes as gently as a kiss and sometimes as cruelly as a bullet. They are part of Eli Reed's America--and ours. 135 duotones</p><p>This stunning portfolio of photographs shows the exquisite range of Black America, its pain and its sorrow, its joy and triumph, and, above all, its humanity. Eli Reed, a photographer and filmmaker, winner of numerous awards, has crisscrossed the United States from the Carolinas to California, documenting the many faces of black life. Here are children playing gleefully on wrecked cars in Harlem, a homeless couple in Philadelphia, seemingly too dispirited to look at the camera, and prom-goers at a Brooklyn high school. In his introduction, Reed writes that he began photographing black people as a &#34;simple way of honoring my parents and acknowledging what they had experienced during their lives.&#34; He has done just that in representing the black experience faithfully and with dignity.Award-winning photographer Eli Reed&#39;s work has appeared in newspapers and magazines worldwide. His first book, Beirut: City of Regrets, was published by Norton.

Decadent socialites packing Lugars. Cotillions. With towns like Savannah, Georgia, who needs Fellini? <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i> takes two narrative strands--each worthy of its own book--and weaves them together to make a single fascinating tale. The first is author John Berendt's loving depiction of the characters and rascals that prowled Savannah in the eight years it was his home-away-from-home. "Eccentrics thrive in Savannah," he writes, and proves the point by introducing Luther Diggers, a thwarted inventor who just might be plotting to poison the town's water supply; Joe Odom, a jovial jackleg lawyer and squatter nonpareil; and, most memorably, the Lady Chablis, whom you really should meet for yourself. Then, on May 2, 1981, the book's second story line commences, when Jim Williams, a wealthy antique dealer and Savannah's host with the most, kills his "friend" Danny Hansford. (If those quotes make you suspect something, you should.) Was it self-defense, as Williams claimed--or murder? The book sketches four separate trials, during which the dark side of this genteel party town is well and truly plumbed.Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty, early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case. <p><br>It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the "soul of pampered self-absorption"; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight.

Set in Suffolk during World War II, when Foreman was very young, the stories meander among small, intriguing details. Bomb shelters, local characters and sweetshop treats are remembered and enlivened with beautiful, evocative illustrations. Foreman's sketches and full-color watercolors are sprinkled across the wide format, while reproductions of airplane specifications and other period details keep this from looking like just another picture book. Similar to Roald Dahl's autobiographical Boy and Going Solo, the book combines pictures and quirky, sometimes dark memories in a not-strictly chronological fashion. Like Dahl's stories, however, Foreman's memoirs charm and amuse while giving a close and personal view of the war. Altogether, this is an unusual and enjoyable book whose audience, while nonspecific, spans age groups and interests.

Whether they know it or not, Baxter's characters are floating above an abyss of unruly desire, inexplicable dread, unforeseen tragedy, and sudden moments of grace.<br><br>A drunken graduate student hurtles cheerfully through a snowstorm to rescue a fiancee who no longer wants him. A hospital maintenance worker makes a perverse bid for his place in the sunlight of celebrity. A man and a woman who have lost their only child cling fiercely to the one thing they have left of her--their grief. Lit by the quiet lightning of Baxter's prose, <b>Through the Safety Net</b> is filled with rare artistry and feeling.</p><p>Read one paragraph of a Charles Baxter story, and you know you're in the hands of a master. Consider, for example, the opening line of "Winter Journey": "Harrelson, perpetual Ph.D. student, poverty-stricken dissertation nonfinisher, academic man of all work, gourmand, stands in the tiny kitchen cluttered with yellow note pads, a basketball, books, misplaced bookmarks, and boxes of ant killer, staring down at a dented saucepan of cold soup." In a single sentence, Baxter has limned a whole life. The story that follows of Harrelson's drunken drive through the snow to rescue a fianc�e who no longer wants him simply fills in the contours. Baxter specializes in ordinary lives--each story is an accretion of details, some funny, some disturbing, that create a complete world. The events that happen in this world are equally ordinary--people make love, make dinner, make decisions they may or may not carry out--but just when you think you know where things are going, Baxter throws in a gentle curve that sends you right off the road. <p> The title story, for example, takes the reader through a day in the life of Dinah Nadler, a dentist, wife, and mother whose regular consultations with a psychic take a dark turn. His warning that there's a "black spot ... blinking, at the horizon" of her life freights even the most commonplace actions with dread. Baxter only hints at what might be happening in Dinah's life, but he does it so well that the ambiguity of his mild-seeming conclusion, "Then she went back to the window, cupped her hands on both sides of her face, and looked outside to see what was happening," is truly chilling. Each of the 11 stories in this collection demonstrates Baxter's quirky, chiaroscuro view of the universe, and also stands as testimony to the fact that he is one of the best fiction writers at work today. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>&#34;Mr. Baxter&#39;s stories are intelligent, original, gracefully written, always moving, frequently funny and--that rarest of compliments--wise.&#34;--New York Times Book Review</p><h2>Dark Magic (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 4)</h2><p>Young mistress of illusion Savannah Dubrinsky resists the almost-supernatural attraction she feels for Gregori, a legendary Carpathinan healer called &#34;The Dark One&#34;.</p><p>CHRISTINE FEEHAN has had more than forty novels published, including titles that have hit number one on the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller list.&nbsp;In addition to being a nominee for the Romance Writers of America's RITA&nbsp;Award, she has received many honors throughout her career, including a Career Achievement Award from&nbsp;<i>Romantic Times</i>&nbsp;and the Borders 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award.''Christine Feehan's magically enthralling series continues with the story of dark and charismatic Gregori.

One of a handful of death camp survivors to fictionalize his experiences in German, H. G. Adler is an essential author&#x2014;referenced by W. G. Sebald in his classic novel <i>Austerlitz</i>, and a direct literary descendant of Kafka.<br><br>When <i>The Journey</i> was discovered in a Harvard bookshop and translated by Peter Filkins, it began a major reassessment of the Prague-born H. G. Adler by literary critics and historians alike. Known for his monumental <i>Theresienstadt 1941&#x2013;1945</i>, a day-by-day account of his experiences in the Nazi slave-labor community before he was sent to Auschwitz, Adler also wrote six novels. The very depiction of the Holocaust in fiction caused furious debate and delays in their publication. Now <i>Panorama</i>, his first novel, written in 1948, is finally available to convey the kinds of truths that only fiction can.<br><br>A brilliant epic, <i>Panorama</i> is a portrait of a place and people soon to be destroyed, as seen through the eyes of young Josef Kramer. Told in ten distinct scenes, it begins in pastoral Word War I&#x2013;era Bohemia, where the boy passively witnesses the &#x201c;wonders of the world&#x201d; in a thrilling panorama display; follows him to a German boarding school full of creeping xenophobia and prejudice; and finds him in young adulthood sent to a labor camp and then to one of the infamous extermination camps, before he chooses exile abroad after the war. Josef&#x2019;s philosophical journey mirrors the author&#x2019;s own: from a stoic acceptance of events to a realization that &#x201c;the viewer is also the participant&#x201d; and that action must be taken in life, if only to make sure the dead are not forgotten.<br><br>Achieving a stream-of-consciousness power reminiscent of James Joyce and Gertrude Stein, H. G. Adler is a modern artist with unique historical importance. <i>Panorama</i> is lasting evidence of both the torment of his life and the triumph of his gifts.</p><p><b>H. G. Adler</b> was the author of twenty-six books of fiction, poetry, philosophy, and history. A survivor of the Holocaust, Adler later settled in England and began writing novels about his experience. Working as a freelance writer and teacher throughout his life, Adler died in London in 1988.<br>&nbsp;<br> <b>Peter Filkins</b> is an acclaimed translator and the recipient of a Berlin Prize fellowship in 2005 from the American Academy in Berlin, among other honors.

We&#x2019;re going to the panorama.&#x201d; Josef hears the voice of his grandmother and looks up from his toy. Panorama. Various pictures from all over the world. &#x201c;Really, are we going?&#x201d; The toy is abandoned, the dominoes, the building set, the train. It&#x2019;s a long way, yet Josef and his grandmother love the panorama. They sit in the streetcar, the motor rattles and sings. Josef often plays streetcar. He runs along the long curbstones of the sidewalk, which is the track. Josef hums with his mouth closed and imitates the streetcar. First he calls out, &#x201c;Ding! Dong Dong!,&#x201d; then comes the humming and sighing of the motor. Streetcar conductor is the best job of all, for you get to sell tickets, punch the tickets, and call out the stops.<br><br>&#x201c;We have to get off, Josef, come!&#x201d; They draw past the embankment and see many people all dressed up. &#x201c;Give me your hand! It&#x2019;s so crowded here.&#x201d; Already they have turned in to the quiet little lane where the panorama is located. Now they stand before the door. It&#x2019;s a simple storefront with a small display window, and there Josef peers at the beautiful pictures, whether it be Vesuvius, Niagara Falls, the Great Pyramid, or other wonders of the world. There&#x2019;s also an announcement for that day&#x2019;s program. Josef sounds it out: &#x201c;Li-ma, the Cap-i-tal of Pe-ru.&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;Come, come, there&#x2019;s more to see inside.&#x201d; They next enter a little lobby that is separated from the actual panorama by a heavy curtain. Behind a table on which stands a sign that says tickets sits a powdered woman. Grandmother gives her a silver coin and takes from the powdery lady two little red tickets, as well as a nickel and some copper change. Josef is allowed to pocket the nickel. &#x201c;Save it! Don&#x2019;t spend it on sweets!&#x201d;<br><br>The grandmother weaves her way with Josef through the curtain and enters an almost completely darkened room. Around a polyhedral wooden cabinet high stools are arranged. In front of each one there are two round openings, which are dark peepholes located beneath a metal shield. You hold your eyes up or press them to the shield and the program appears. An attendant receives the guests and takes them to two free spots. The grandmother sits down, but the attendant lifts Josef up and presses him close to the peepholes. The two peepholes are there so that you see everything just the way it really looks, and everything is enlarged so that it seems completely alive. Everything appears lit by brilliant golden light, as if dipped in tropical sunlight. Each picture stands there for a minute, maybe less. To Josef it feels like a good long time. He&#x2019;s pleased that it lasts so long, for he can&#x2019;t get enough of the splendid sights. But it&#x2019;s a shame that the people, animals, and wagons in the pictures don&#x2019;t move. Though the fact they don&#x2019;t move doesn&#x2019;t make the life depicted in the beautiful pictures any less marvelous, it does make them seem like something outside of time. Before the pictures change, the delicate strike of a little bell warns: &#x201c;Attention, time&#x2019;s up! Get ready for the next wonder!&#x201d; Then the picture moves away, another draws near, the next stands before Josef at last. If he doesn&#x2019;t turn his gaze away from the peepholes and presses his face hard against the shield, he feels completely alone with the pictures. The daily world disappears and is gone. The viewer and the picture become one on the inside, no one can get in. Josef himself, however, cannot wander off into the pictures, for he remains sitting on his stool, his upper body bent forward slightly. Because of this he cannot sit comfortably, nor is there any chair back, so there&#x2019;s no resting at all. In the panorama, however, that doesn&#x2019;t matter. Josef is content. One can be comfortable anywhere else, it&#x2019;s only in the panorama that this isn&#x2019;t possible. Everything here is hard and fixed and tense. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s not necessary for the grandmother to say, &#x201c;Pay attention, in order that you get something out of this and learn from it!&#x201d; Only when the pictures change does the tension ease for just a moment. Josef scoots forward on his stool in order to see better still. Beneath the peepholes a piece of tin is attached against which he breathes. The tin gathers moisture and sometimes Josef likes to run his fingers over its smooth flatness so that his fingertips feel damp. The grandmother pays no attention to Josef, for she knows how the panorama captivates him, so much so that he is better behaved than usual. That&#x2019;s why the little naughtiness with wiping his fingers remains ignored. Normally there is no opportunity here to misbehave. The otherwise familiar world has disappeared. Here is another world, which one can only gaze at, there being no other way to enter but to gaze. Only these little holes are there for the eyes. Josef can see so for himself, simply by touching the glass, that there is no other way in. All the people and the distant lands that you encounter in these pictures remain untouchable behind the glass walls that are only large enough for the eyes.<br><br>It&#x2019;s fairly quiet in the panorama. Except for the little bell that announces the change in pictures, you only hear the guests coming and going, or a stool scraping, now and then a couple of words someone might whisper to his neighbor. You hardly ever hear the attendant. Thus the world you normally live in is turned off, and has in fact passed away. Another world is risen, which neither reading nor studying nor even dreams can manifest. Nonetheless, Josef can step only a little way into the other world, though he cannot take part in it. If he shoves his knee forward he immediately bumps up against the wooden cabinet. Soon it&#x2019;s clear how little is allowed. Everywhere there are barriers, nowhere can you immerse yourself entirely. Josef sees the other world, but it doesn&#x2019;t care about him. It consists only of parts that are put together. The only way for it to be different would be for the pictures to move, to continue on and flow into one another, yet each is presented on its own and is clearly separated from the next. The other world is a program that is immensely beautiful, but nothing more. Next week the program changes, and so on week after week. There is no whole, only individual pieces without end. Even today&#x2019;s program has no proper end but just repeats itself over and over. There are perhaps sixty, maybe eighty pictures, though there certainly are not a hundred. Eventually a picture comes along that has been there already. Josef doubts this at first, but after the next chiming of the little bell another picture appears that is also familiar. The grandmother still looks on. She starts to get restless on her chair. After the little bell strikes again and a third picture arrives that most certainly has been there already, the grandmother turns to Josef. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s over, my dear. We&#x2019;ve seen that one already. We have to go.&#x201d;<br><br>The grandmother stands. The attendant is already there and lifts Josef down; the grandmother helps and takes the boy by the hand. Then the attendant pulls back the curtain. In the lobby the daylight is so strong that the grandmother warns, &#x201c;Child, close your eyes!&#x201d; She doesn&#x2019;t have to say anything, for Josef squints and allows himself to be led out almost blind. The grandmother doesn&#x2019;t let on how much it all pleased her, but says, &#x201c;Be careful, and watch where you&#x2019;re going.&#x201d; Josef doesn&#x2019;t know whether the warning is about the spectacle in the panorama or the way that leads home.</p><h2>Willing to Believe: The Controversy over Free Will</h2><p>What is the role of the will in believing the good news of the gospel? Why is there so much controversy over free will throughout church history? R. C. Sproul finds that Christians have often been influenced by pagan views of the human will that deny the effects of Adam's fall. <br> In <i>Willing to Believe,</i> Sproul traces the free-will controversy from its formal beginning in the fifth century, with the writings of Augustine and Pelagius, to the present. Readers will gain understanding into the nuances separating the views of Protestants and Catholics, Calvinists and Arminians, and Reformed and Dispensationalists. This book, like Sproul's <i>Faith Alone,</i> is a major work on an essential evangelical tenet.</p><p>What is the role of the will in believing the good news of the gospel?

It was December 1937 when the young Laurie Lee crossed the Pyrenees and walked into the bitter winter of the Spanish Civil War. With great vividness and poignancy, Lee portrays the brave defeat of youthful idealism in Auden&#39;s &#39;low dishonest decade&#39;. Writing in the &#34;Literary Review&#34;, John Sweeney praised the memoir as, &#39;A great, heart-stopping narrative of one young Englishman&#39;s part in the war in Spain ...crafted by a poet, stamping an indelible image of the boredom, random cruelty and stupidity of war&#39;.</p><p><b>Laurie Lee </b>was born in 1914 in Stroud, Gloucestershire, and was brought up with his mother and many siblings. At the age of nineteen he walked to London and then traveled on foot through Spain as described in <i>As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning</i>. He married Catherine Polge and had one daughter; he died in 1997.Naivet&#x17d; and modern warfare meet in the midst of the Spanish Civil War. Young Lee arrives in Spain prepared for battle though not for the skepticism nor his imprisonment. Thorne's matter-of-fact, almost conversational recital captures young Lee's trusting enthusiasm. Events, both petty and horrendous, are made credible without emotional histrionics. The reader's quiet energy gives Lee's character unspoken wonder and fear. Thorne provides well-rendered characterizations and near-perfect multi-national accents. It's a curious, yet compelling, odyssey. S.B.S.

At age twenty-four, Hornbacher was diagnosed with Type I rapid-cycle bipolar, the most severe form of bipolar disorder.<br><br>In Madness, in her trademark wry and utterly self-revealing voice, Hornbacher tells her new story. Through scenes of astonishing visceral and emotional power, she takes us inside her own desperate attempts to counteract violently careening mood swings by self-starvation, substance abuse, numbing sex, and self-mutilation. How Hornbacher fights her way up from a madness that all but destroys her, and what it is like to live in a difficult and sometimes beautiful life and marriage -- where bipolar always beckons -- is at the center of this brave and heart-stopping memoir.<br><br>Madness delivers the revelation that Hornbacher is not alone: millions of people in America today are struggling with a variety of disorders that may disguise their bipolar disease. And Hornbacher's fiercely self-aware portrait of her own bipolar as early as age four will powerfully change, too, the current debate on whether bipolar in children actually exists.<br><br>Ten years after Kay Redfield Jamison's An Unquiet Mind, this storm of a memoir will revolutionize our understanding of bipolar disorder.</p><p>"Hornbacher is a virtuoso writer." - <i>New York Times</i><i></i>&nbsp;When Marya Hornbacher published&nbsp;a nationally bestselling memoir of her battle with anorexia and bulimia she had no idea that there was a piece of shattering knowledge that wouold finally make sense of the chaos of her life.&nbsp;Her struggles with&nbsp;mental illness, and&nbsp;the story she would have to tell about them, were far from over.&nbsp;At twenty-four,&nbsp;Hornbacher was diagnosed with Type I rapid-cycle bipolar disorder, the most severe form.

Brush your teeth because it prevents cavities? Naaaw. By breaking into the National Dental Association (disguised as the Tooth Fairy), Wisniewski has discovered that kids should brush their teeth because not doing so causes... unrest: "Reckless incisors cavort with Ginger Vitus... Pulp Rocker Tommy Rot sings inflammatory lyrics...." Yes, Wisniewski crams in every possible pun, and his inimitable style of paper cut-out illustrations is the visually punning equivalent. The underlying idea here is fun, but it remains a mystery as to why adults would have a global conspiracy to conceal explanations that are, in the end, just more imaginative versions of the ones they do give. For example: kids should avoid junk food not because it's plain bad for them but rather because it causes each CFG (Cruddy Food Group molecule) to steal a bit of your brain and "drive it to an abandoned warehouse in an unpleasant industrial section of your body."

Collected Poems offers the first full portrait of Ceravolo&#39;s aesthetic trajectory, bringing to light the highly original voice that was operating at an increasing remove from the currents of the time. From a poetics associated with Frank O&#39;Hara and John Ashbery to an ever more contemplative, deeply visionary poetics similar in sensibility to Zen and Dante, William Blake and St. John of the Cross, this collection shows how Ceravolo&#39;s poetry takes on a direct, quiet lyricism: intensely dedicated to the natural and spiritual life of the individual. As Ron Silliman notes, Ceravolo&#39;s later work reveals him to be &#34;one of the most emotionally open, vulnerable and self-knowing poets of his generation.&#34; Many new pieces, including the masterful long poem &#34;The Hellgate,&#34; are published here for the first time.

In a provincial university town Caro Grimstone, a dissatisfied faculty wife, becomes the unwilling accomplice to her husband Alan&#39;s ambitions. When she volunteers as a reader to a blind, esteemed anthropologist, Alan seizes the opportunity to steal his papers - research that could both advance his reputation while refuting the findings of a respected colleague.</p><p>Barbara Pym (1913-80) was born in Shropshire and educated at St Hilda&#39;s College, Oxford. When in 1977 the TLS asked critics to name the most underrated authors of the past 75 years, only one was named twice (by Philip Larkin and Lord David Cecil): Barbara Pym. Her novels are characterised by what Anne Tyler has called &#39;the heartbreaking silliness of everyday life&#39;.Pym's reputation will not be enhanced by the publication of this edited first draft of a novel from her "silent years." Set in a provincial university, the story is narrated by Caro Grimstone, the dissatisfied wife of Alan, a rising anthropologist. Caro unwittingly becomes the means by which Alan dishonestly obtains a manuscript that will both advance his reputation and refute the findings of a respected, elderly colleague. Around this academic misdemeanor, the Grimstones and a cast of unrealized academic eccentrics revolve until the whole is resolved in a literal burst of fireworks. Absent is Pym's genius for creating characters whose concerns, no matter how trivial, engage the reader. Her fans, however, will probably demand the book. Andrea Caron Kempf, Johnson Cty.

Only hours earlier two masked men had walked the mild-mannered accountant out of his farmhouse and clinically blasted him with a shotgun. Clearly this is a professional hit -- but Keith was hardly the sort of person to make deadly enemies. Or was he? For the police investigation soon raises more questions than answers. And who, exactly, is Robert Calvert? The more Banks scratches the surface, the more he wonders what lies beneath the veneer of the apparently happy Rothwell family. And when his old sparring partner Detective Superintendent Richard Burgess arrives from Scotland Yard, the case takes yet another unexpected twist...&#39;The novels of Peter Robinson are chilling, evocative, deeply nuanced works of art.&#39; Dennis Lehane &#39;Peter Robinson&#39;s cast of characters is vividly drawn.

Jan Zwicky defends the claim that we experience meaning in the apprehension of wholes and their internal structural relations, providing examples of such insight in mathematics and physics, literature, music, and Plato&#39;s ancient theory of forms. Taken together, these essays constitute a powerful indictment of the aggressive reductionism and the reliance on calculative modes of thought that dominate our present conception of understanding. The Experience of Meaning proposes a more just epistemology, arguing for a new grammar of thought, a new way of understanding the relationship of human intelligence to the world. Engaging with philosophy, psychology, literature, fine arts, music, and environmental studies in a profound way, The Experience of Meaning will interest any reader who ponders the question of meaning and its relation to true human expression.</p><p>Jan Zwicky, an internationally recognized poet and scholar, has held appointments at numerous universities including Princeton, the University of Alberta, and the University of Victoria. She is the author of several books, including Alkibiades&#39; Love: Essays in Philosophy."Rich and thought-provoking, The Experience of Meaning will change the way you see the world. I literally could not put this book down and I think all readers will be as entranced as I was, although it may resonate differently in each of them." Marjorie S<br><br>"The Experience of Meaning is a courageous, profound book ? broad in scope, yet scholarly and concise. It is truly a joy to read."

Academically and athletically gifted, Farrell grew up in England and Ireland. In 1956, during his first term at Oxford, he suffered what seemed a minor injury on the rugby pitch. Within days, however, he was diagnosed with polio, which nearly killed him and left him permanently weakened. Farrell&#x2019;s early novels, which include&nbsp;<i>The Lung</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>A Girl in the Head,</i>have been overshadowed by his Empire Trilogy&#x2014;<i>Troubles</i>, the Booker Prize&#x2013;winning&nbsp;<i>Siege of Krishnapur,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Singapore Grip</i>&nbsp;(all three are published by&nbsp;NYRB&nbsp;Classics). In early 1979, Farrell bought a farmhouse in Bantry Bay on the Irish coast. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been trying to write,&#x201d; he admitted, &#x201c;but there are so many competing interests&#x2014;the prime one at the moment is fishing off the rocks... . Then a colony of bees has come to live above my back door and I&#x2019;m thinking of turning them into my feudal retainers.&#x201d; On August 11, Farrell was hit by a wave while fishing and was washed out to sea.

The key is all in the planning. How much a house costs, how it looks, how comfortable it is, how energy-efficient it is&#x2014;all these things occur on paper before you pick up even one tool. A little extra time spent in the planning process can save tens of thousands of dollars in construction and maintenance. That is time well spent! </p><p>Living Homes takes you through the planning process to design an energy- and resource-efficient home that won&#x2019;t break the bank. Then, from the footings on up to the roof, author Thomas J. Elpel guides you through the nuts and bolts of footings and foundations, slipform stone masonry, tilt-up stone walls, log home construction, building with strawbales, windows and doors, concrete and fly ash countertops, masonry heaters, terra tile floors, wood framing, solar hot water, plus plumbing, painting, and more!</p></p><p>A Positive Relationship with Nature <p>Our culture teaches us that we are separate from nature. We spend most of our lives in houses surrounded by manicured lawns, living in towns or cities where recrecational activies are based on human-centered sports. Nature is something we go to a park to see, or we watch a show about it on TV. </p><p>Those of us in the field of environmental education try to preach a different message, telling people that "all life is interconnected" and that "we really are part of nature". But in the next breath we tell them to stay on the trails and to practice "no-trace" camping. We tell them to look at nature and photograph it, but not to touch it. We tell them our modern way of life is destroying nature, and that we need to stop mucking up the planet. In other words, we tell them we are part of nature--the bad part! </p><p>Here at HOPS Press, LLC we advocate a positive interactive relationship with the natural world. We want people to get involved in nature, to be a part of the process on many levels: </p><p>Through Participating in Nature: Thomas J.

Learn to set aside the trappings of modern culture and step directly into nature with little or nothing, to experience nature on its own terms. </p><p>With Tom's book Botany in a Day: The Patterns Method of Plant Identification, you can connect with the wonderful diversity of plants and flowers all around you in a way that you may have never imagined.

Our book Shanleya's Quest: A Botany Adventure for Kids Ages 9-99 utilizes the same patterns method of identifying plants as Botany in a Day, but in a metaphorical story form where children of all ages can join young Shanleya on her journey to learn the plant traditions of her people. </p><p>In Living Homes: Integrated Design &amp; Construction you will learn how to make your home part of nature, as well as how to make nature part of your home. Learn the secrets to building low-cost, high-efficiency homes with stone masonry, log-building and strawbale construction methods. With this book and Tom's Slipform Stone Masonry DVD/VHS Video you will be able to build your quality, earth-friendly Dream home on a budget, even while the "experts" say it isn't cost effective. </p><p>Finally, in Direct Pointing to Real Wealth: Thomas J.

Learn the basic rules of this economic ecosystem and you will be empowered to use your resources to more effectively achieve your desired quality of life, while making the world a better place to be. You will be able help convert an economy that harms planetary biodiversity into an economy that helps restore it.</p>"Our house may look expensive, but the reality is that we only have about $10 a square foot into it. The whole house cost about as much as the average new car. Yet I have seen some million dollar homes that looked like junk. Appearance, like energy efficiency, is more a product of design than of cost. You can take the same materials and arrange them poorly or arrange them well." <p>"With a combined income averaging $10,000 to $12,000 a year we lived simply and invested everything we could in building materials. Construction proceeded slowly throughout the process, due to our chronic lack of money. We moved into the house after the second summer, with no doors, few windows, and no insulation in the roof. Winter stopped about three feet from the stove. This might all seem a little rough, but I later realized that we saved at least $150,000 in interest payments by eliminating the need for a loan. That is not a bad wage for a couple years of camping out!"</p></p><h2>D-Day Deception: Operation Fortitude and the Normandy Invasion (Stackpole Military History Series)</h2><p>Before landing in France on D-Day, June 6, 1944, the Allies executed an elaborate deception plan designed to prevent the Germans from concentrating forces in Normandy. The lesser-known first part, Fortitude North, suggested a threat to Norway. The more famous Fortitude South indicated that the invasion would occur at the Pas de Calais rather than Normandy, largely by creating a fictitious army group under Gen. George S. Patton. While historians have generally praised Operation Fortitude, Barbier takes a more nuanced view, arguing that the deception, while implemented well, affected the invasion's outcome only minimally.<li>A much-needed reassessment of the deception operation that preceded the Allied invasion of Europe in World War II </li><li>Involves double agents, fake equipment, phantom units, and famous commanders</li></p><p><p>A new take on D-Day, showing that the successful deception of Operation Fortitude has received more than its fair share of credit for the Normandy invasions, obscuring not just the real invasion plans, but German weaknesses that contributed to Allied victory.</p>Mary Kathryn Barbier is a professor of history at Mississippi State University, where she teaches American history, military history, and grand strategy.

This upbeat picture book follows an exuberant little boy through his day. The quick-paced text uses short phrases and many active words, hitting the high points in his own words. Generally the words, the rhymes, and the near-rhymes read aloud well, though occasionally the word choice is a little awkward, as in "Close the light. Say good night. Sleep sweet dreams." Even nonreaders, though, will be able to enjoy the activities and emotions so clearly portrayed in the bright illustrations. Very young children may be confused by seeing more than one picture of young Peter on a single spread, but they will have no doubt of what is happening in each one, even if they don't yet go to the library, practice violin, or take a bath by themselves (How old <i>is</i> this child?). On the other hand, very young children will delight in recognizing the many everyday activities (brushing teeth, taking off pajamas, putting on socks) depicted on the page. A cheerful picture book that many preschoolers will enjoy. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

With a few found objects, like buttons and fabric and seeds, and a little imagination, you can create a whole family out of snow. &#x201c;Ehlert uses collages of cut paper and vibrant, textured objects to dazzling effect in her tribute to building a snowman--and snowgirl and snowcat.

The contrasting sensations of the crisp iciness and dreary isolation of winter are effectively created by placing the colorfully decorated white figures against a textured gray background on double-page vertical spreads. The background glows bright orange as the sun appears. Ehlert concludes her book with some winter facts, photographs of snowmen, and a recipe for popcorn balls.

She lives in Falmouth, Maine, with her husband and children.PreSchool-Grade 1-- A cumulative, didactic tale. Hearing his own cry, "I need a friend," called back from across the pond, Little Beaver sets out to find the creature who shares his problem. As he journeys to find out who was crying, he is joined by an otter, a duck, and a turtle, all of whom also want companionship. Ultimately, they meet a wise old beaver who explains about Echo, and they make Echo sound happy when they discover that they are friends. Little Beaver is a fat, furry little fellow who is apparently intended to look natural, although he has the demeanor of a greeting card creature. This anthropomorphic approach is neither realistic nor convincing in presenting a human dilemma enacted by animals. The lovely soft watercolor scenes bespeak the British artist's experience as a natural-history illustrator. The issue concerning Echo is somewhat confusing, however, and the flat, precious conclusion about friendship is clearly stated but predictable. --Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Sinner: A Rizzoli &amp; Isles Novel</h2><p>Not even the icy temperatures of a typical New England winter can match the bone-chilling scene of carnage discovered at the chapel of Our Lady of Divine Light.

Because of the character-driven nature of his art, the accounts tend toward the best story pieces, with lots of Genesis included (Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Abraham and Sarah, and more), as well as stories from other Old Testament books such as Joshua and Ruth, through which readers can become acquainted with the individuals. The New Testament collapses many books into a couple of sections but includes several of Jesus's parables and ends with a surprise twist on the Book of Revelation. While costuming tends toward a kind of storied old Middle East (and women's forms are visible but always clothed), an occasional story line will have some updated visual metaphor attached to it: a mid-20th-century crime boss or a nuclear warhead, for instance. Each story includes a marginal tab directing readers to the book, chapter, and verse where a more traditional account can be found in the Bible. Accessible, respectful, and creative, this is an excellent resource both for manga-loving teens who are familiar with The Book and for teens who have no familiarity with the traditional text and are looking for an engaging overview.<i>&#x2013;Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She&#x2019;s the cutest snake I&#x2019;ve ever seen.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Emily,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;long slimy reptiles with no eyelids or ears are not cute. They&#x2019;re creepy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ginger&#x2019;s not slimy. Her skin is dry. Come pet her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t pet snakes, or anything else that could eat me whole for lunch.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Our family was spending the morning at the West End Avenue street fair. The whole block was lined with booths selling everything from blueberry muffins to tube socks. Leave it to Emily to find the one snake booth. That girl can sniff out a reptile better than my dog, Cheerio, can sniff out a hunk of pot roast under the dining-room table.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ignoring Emily, I headed for a booth that was selling cool comic books. Emily stood there and stomped her foot.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mom! Dad!&#x201d; she whined. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t fair. We just spent twenty minutes waiting for Hank to taste every flavor of ice cream when we knew he was going to pick cherry-vanilla all along. Now the family should do something I want to do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Emily has a good point, Hank,&#x201d; my mom said. &#x201c;I think we should all go say hello to Ginger the snake.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I muttered. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not touching her with any part of my body. I will use my eyes and that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We walked over to a large purple sign that read Ralph&#x2019;s Reptile Show. Under the sign, there was a table with some reptiles displayed in different kinds of glass tanks. A giant tortoise was sitting in the middle of the table. And when I say giant, I mean <i>giant</i>. That guy&#x2019;s shell was as big as my bathroom sink. In front of the table was Ralph himself, with a long orange, yellow, and black striped snake wrapped around his arm.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s Ginger!&#x201d; Emily screamed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hi, Emily,&#x201d; Ralph said. &#x201c;Oh, I see you&#x2019;ve brought your family over to meet Ginger.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all so excited to get to know her,&#x201d; Emily said, reaching out to stroke Ginger&#x2019;s long back.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Make that all but one of us,&#x201d; I added quickly. &#x201c;I hope this doesn&#x2019;t hurt your feelings, Ralph, but I&#x2019;m not a big snake petter.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, then maybe I can interest you in Clive, my snow leopard gecko,&#x201d; Ralph said. &#x201c;Or Boris, my adorable blue-tailed skink.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Okay, I don&#x2019;t even know what a skink is. But it sounds too close to &#x201c;stink&#x201d; for me to even consider petting it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ralph was wearing a tan floppy hat that looked like his head had sweated in it for at least a hundred years. He had on a brown shirt and shorts, brown construction boots, and a shirt with a million pockets and zippers. Maybe that&#x2019;s where he keeps his skinks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is that tortoise even alive?&#x201d; I asked Ralph. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not moving.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You mean Speedy?&#x201d; Ralph petted the tortoise&#x2019;s bumpy head with two fingers. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s probably just thinking about the lettuce leaf he had for lunch. If you want a little more excitement, you should get to know Ginger. She&#x2019;s a hoot.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ralph moved his arm so that Ginger&#x2019;s face was very close to my nose. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t <i>very</i> close, but it was close enough for me to jump way back.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Look at Hank,&#x201d; Emily laughed. &#x201c;Afraid of a little snake.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not afraid, exactly,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t happen to love snakes the same way you do. Maybe I&#x2019;m not an animal person.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You love Cheerio, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course. But Cheerio&#x2019;s a dog, which means you can play ball with him. And take him for a walk. Last time I checked, they don&#x2019;t make leashes for snakes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Snakes are very sweet in their own way,&#x201d; Ralph said. &#x201c;Take Ginger, for instance. She&#x2019;s a mud snake. She loves children. She&#x2019;s a big hit at kids&#x2019; birthday parties.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; Emily said. &#x201c;I wish she could come to mine. It&#x2019;s coming up soon. I already sent out the invitations and everything.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ralph reached down to the stack of brochures he had on the table and handed my dad one.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I bring my reptile show to lots of kids&#x2019; birthday parties,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;d be happy to come to Emily&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a deal!&#x201d; Emily said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to call everyone I&#x2019;ve invited and let them know that there&#x2019;s a new theme to my party. Everybody else has a princess dress-up party. Nobody has had snakes before.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s because kids don&#x2019;t like attending birthday parties with creatures whose jaws unlock so they can swallow the birthday cake whole,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what you think, Hank. It&#x2019;s my party.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hold up there, Emily,&#x201d; my dad said, putting the brochure in his coat pocket. &#x201c;We have a lot to discuss here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And we should do that on the way home,&#x201d; my mom said, taking Emily&#x2019;s hand to lead her away from Ralph.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;See you soon,&#x201d; Emily called out to Ralph. &#x201c;Tell Ginger I&#x2019;ll make a special party hat for her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to see about that,&#x201d; my dad whispered to Ralph.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; Ralph answered. &#x201c;My phone number is on the brochure. Let me know as soon as you decide, because Ginger is a very popular snake.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As we walked up 78th Street to our apartment, Emily didn&#x2019;t stop jabbering for a minute. My dad was just the opposite. He was quiet. His eyebrows were all wrinkled and his mouth was turned down into a frown.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Look, Emily,&#x201d; my dad said when we reached our building. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to disappoint you, but we can&#x2019;t have Ralph&#x2019;s Reptile Show at your party. I glanced at the prices, and it&#x2019;s too expensive for us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Emily stopped in her tracks and so did her mouth. She stared at my dad like he had just told her the sky was falling.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But, Daddy,&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only going to turn seven once in my life.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, sweetie,&#x201d; my mom said, &#x201c;we can still have a nice party for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Emily&#x2019;s eyes filled with tears. She pulled open the front door and ran through the hallway to the elevator. I saw her pushing the elevator button like she was hammering a nail with her thumb. I felt sorry for the elevator button, and my mom felt sorry for Emily.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She wants that party so badly,&#x201d; she whispered to my dad.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I wish we could afford it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But we can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We rode up the elevator in silence, except for the sound of Emily sniffling. When we got to our apartment, my dad opened the door, and Cheerio came running out to greet us. Even his wagging tail didn&#x2019;t cheer Emily up. As I petted Cheerio, I remembered how Emily had stood up for me when I wanted to keep him, and my dad had said no. Suddenly, I felt something surprising in the pit of my stomach, and it had nothing to do with wanting a pepperoni pizza.<br> &nbsp;<br> What I wanted was to help my sister. Now, how weird is that?<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Worlds Apart (5) (Story Thieves)</h2><p><b>Owen and Bethany try to find their way back to each other after the fictional and nonfictional worlds are torn apart in this fifth and final book in the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series, Story Thieves<i>&#x2014;</i>which was called a &#x201c;fast-paced, action-packed tale&#x201d; by <i>School Library Journal&#x2014;</i>from the author of the Half Upon a Time trilogy.</b><br><br>Bethany and Owen have failed.

Eventually the doctor pulled out a picture of a dog&#x2014;a spotted dalmatian&#x2014;and showed it to him. &#x201c;Now close your eyes and try to picture this dog in your head,&#x201d; he instructed Owen.<br> <br>Owen nodded. But once his eyes closed, he frowned, realizing he couldn&#x2019;t bring an image of the dog into his mind. It was like there was a complete blank. He could remember words describing the dog, like &#x201c;dalmatian,&#x201d; &#x201c;spotted,&#x201d; &#x201c;tail,&#x201d; and &#x201c;paws,&#x201d; but for whatever reason, he couldn&#x2019;t build an image using those words. He opened his eyes again, a bit confused, and stared harder at the photo. This shouldn&#x2019;t be that difficult. He could see it clearly, right there in front of him. This wasn&#x2019;t complicated.<br> <br>Owen shut his eyes again, knowing he could do this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and came up blank.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t picture it,&#x201d; he said, wondering why he didn&#x2019;t feel more frustrated.<br> <br>&#x201c;The technical term for what&#x2019;s happening to you is aphantasia,&#x201d; the doctor said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve lost the ability to visualize anything in your head. Basically, your imagination doesn&#x2019;t exist anymore. But don&#x2019;t let it worry you. I can&#x2019;t imagine it&#x2019;ll affect your life too much.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s odd,&#x201d; Owen&#x2019;s mother said, raising one eyebrow. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s always had an active imagination. But ever since he disappeared for a few days and then turned up in London, he&#x2019;s been acting different.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just him,&#x201d; the doctor said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen it in people all over town, from kids to adults to the elderly. It happened to me, even.&#x201d; He showed Owen&#x2019;s mother the picture. &#x201c;Most likely you, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>As his mom went through the same test, Owen stared off into space, feeling strangely calm. Losing his imagination seemed like it should worry him. But it didn&#x2019;t really feel that bad, like the doctor said. So he couldn&#x2019;t picture a dog in his head. It wasn&#x2019;t like that came up too often. And really, what was he using his imagination for anyway? Wasting time in school? Making up things that didn&#x2019;t exist? Nothing important, in other words.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t picture it either, you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; his mother said, opening her eyes. &#x201c;So is there a cure?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cure?&#x201d; the doctor said, blinking in confusion. &#x201c;Of course not. This is just how things are now. I can&#x2019;t imagine us ever coming up with a fix.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, as long as it&#x2019;s healthy and normal,&#x201d; his mother said, smiling at the doctor. &#x201c;If Owen&#x2019;s okay, we should be going. My shift starts soon at the library.&#x201d;<br> <br>The doctor wrinkled his nose. &#x201c;Does anyone even come in anymore?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, but we&#x2019;re bringing in more nonfiction,&#x201d; his mother said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all anyone&#x2019;s been checking out lately anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the way to the library, Owen went over the assignments he would have turned in that day in school. Everything seemed correct to him, but he went over them a second time, just to be sure. Math was a subject to be taken very seriously, according to adults, and he trusted their judgment.<br> <br>They arrived at the library a few minutes after Owen started his math assignment over, so he sadly placed his papers in the textbook, marking his spot. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you get your London punishment out of the way first?&#x201d; his mother said. &#x201c;That way you can enjoy your schoolwork as a reward.&#x201d;<br> <br>That seemed logical. After Owen had spent a few days away from home, first in Jupiter City and then trapped with Kara Dox in a time prison, his mother had gone a bit insane, contacting every police station and hospital within four states. But as soon as Owen called her from London, she immediately calmed down and arranged for him to fly back.<br> <br>He hadn&#x2019;t expected that, honestly, but now knowing that she had no imagination helped explain things: She literally couldn&#x2019;t imagine him ever returning while he was missing, so had completely lost it. But now that he was back, she couldn&#x2019;t picture him leaving again, so his punishment was more about the principle.<br> <br>She did ask where he&#x2019;d been, though, and he obviously told the truth: He&#x2019;d been helping Bethany, who was half-fictional, find her missing father in a superhero comic, only to be thrown into a Pick the Plot book by a fictional man named Nobody, who had then separated the fictional and nonfictional worlds and sent Owen and Bethany back to the nonfictional world through the last open portal between their worlds, the one that led to Neverland. And since that portal connected to London, that&#x2019;s where they emerged.<br> <br>She seemed a bit confused by some of the explanation, but couldn&#x2019;t imagine any other way he could have gotten to London, so accepted his story. Logic dictated that he should be punished for his actions, so in spite of not being able to picture him ever repeating his crimes, she and Bethany&#x2019;s mother had agreed on a punishment: Bethany and Owen would help Owen&#x2019;s mother in her library every night for a year.<br> <br>That didn&#x2019;t seem that bad to Owen, since that&#x2019;s what he did most nights anyway. And now he had an excuse to hang out with Bethany every evening, doing homework or quizzing each other on facts they could memorize. All in all, it was a pretty pleasant punishment.<br> <br>What wasn&#x2019;t pleasant, though, was having to deal with the books at the library. As his mother had said, almost no one came in anymore, so Owen and Bethany ended up spending most of their time clearing fiction books off the shelves to make room for more nonfiction.<br> <br>Not that Owen could blame them: Though he&#x2019;d once spent most of his time reading, now whenever Owen tried to read his old favorite books, he couldn&#x2019;t picture the stories in his head. Without an imagination, he was just reading words, not seeing any characters or situations.<br> <br>But like the doctor had said, was that really a bad thing? Now he had so much more time for the nonfictional world, and for performing tasks that he was given to the best of his abilities. What better way to get ahead in life than that? Owen couldn&#x2019;t imagine anything.<br> <br>And making room for nonfictional books in the library was easy enough. Spike, his fictional cat, sat in the empty spaces in the bookshelves, periodically jumping up to a higher one just to get a better look. Every so often Spike would meow, and Owen would pet him, which always made him miss his fictional friends for some reason, and he&#x2019;d wonder what they were doing and where they were now. Were they fighting back against Nobody still? Or had they given up, since things weren&#x2019;t really that bad with the worlds separated?<br> <br>Weirdly, he only seemed to think about them while petting Spike. That made sense, though, since Spike was fictional himself, and logically he&#x2019;d remind Owen of other fictionals.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; said a voice from behind him as Owen scratched Spike&#x2019;s head. He turned around to find Bethany standing there with a worried look on her face as all thoughts of his fictional friends seemed to drain from his mind. &#x201c;Are you okay? I felt so bad that you missed school today!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; Owen said, shrugging. &#x201c;Apparently something&#x2019;s going around. I&#x2019;ll be there tomorrow and can catch up on anything I missed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany&#x2019;s face lit up as she dropped a bag of textbooks into his lap. &#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry! I brought you everything we went over today. I can help you catch up right now.&#x201d; She beamed at him.<br> <br>He returned her smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re way too nice to me, you know that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no such thing,&#x201d; she said, patting him on the shoulder. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my best friend. I&#x2019;m just looking out for you. Besides, after everything the fictional me put you through, I owe you for years.&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen nodded, not wanting to argue the point again. Ever since they&#x2019;d returned, Bethany had decided that her fictional self had been the part of her that had caused all of her problems, from jumping her father into a book in the first place, to getting them kidnapped by Fowen&#x2014;Owen&#x2019;s fictional self&#x2014;to losing Owen to Nobody in Jupiter City. Owen didn&#x2019;t really see how that made sense, but arguing with her about it didn&#x2019;t seem to help, so he&#x2019;d just let it go.<br> <br>&#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t your fault, you know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I could have said no each time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t have put you in that position. If I just hadn&#x2019;t given in to my fictional half over and over, none of it would have happened. It makes me so angry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!&#x201d; She paused and took a deep breath, then slowly let it out. &#x201c;Sorry, I need to stop blaming her. Every time I do, I try to remember Gwen, EarthGirl. She never thought one bad thing about me, no matter how many mistakes I made. Thinking of her helps remind me not to judge myself so harshly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She was pretty great,&#x201d; Owen agreed. &#x201c;You know who I miss the most?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany shrugged. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even imagine.&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen started to say a name, then stopped. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t really matter. We should get back to work. Mom wants us to finish the kids&#x2019; section tonight before we study.&#x201d; He nodded at the books piled behind him. &#x201c;Do you want to start at the back of the alphabet, and I&#x2019;ll take the front?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold up just a moment there, you two,&#x201d; said a deep, booming voice. A man easily seven feet tall strode over to them carrying a box full of books. The man&#x2019;s muscles bulged out of his tailored black suit, and he walked strangely, stopping every few feet to strike a pose. He also wore sunglasses inside, which seemed a bit odd to Owen, given that the lights in the library weren&#x2019;t that bright.<br> <br>The man&#x2019;s sudden appearance sent Spike scrambling to hide elsewhere in the library, which wasn&#x2019;t unusual. The man watched him go with a strange look on his face. &#x201c;Cute cat,&#x201d; he said, turning back to Owen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d; Owen asked him.<br> <br>&#x201c;There was no one at the counter, so I came back here,&#x201d; the man said, dropping the box at Owen&#x2019;s feet. He glanced around and made a disgusted face. &#x201c;Wow, you&#x2019;ve really let this place go, haven&#x2019;t you? Yikes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany gave Owen a confused look that told him she had no idea who the man was either. &#x201c;Did you want to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. donate these books?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I like about you, Bethany,&#x201d; the man said, grinning at her. &#x201c;You always cut to the chase. Yes, that&#x2019;s exactly what I want to do. It&#x2019;s all Kiel Gnomenfoot books, straight from Jonathan Porterhouse.&#x201d; The man took a book out of the box and handed it to Owen. &#x201c;The author said he was tired of having them around. Something about them being really badly written, and the main character is obnoxious and really terrible at magic and deserved to lose?&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen and Bethany shared another odd look. &#x201c;You can definitely donate the books,&#x201d; Owen said to the man, &#x201c;but we&#x2019;ll probably just end up adding them to our book sale. Not many people are checking these books out anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I have a feeling these copies will jump off the shelves&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. eventually,&#x201d; the man said, then winked in an exaggerated way. &#x201c;Just give them time. Now, I really should be going. Have another old friend to see, a long way from here. I&#x2019;ll tell her you both said hi. In the meantime, give that copy a close look, Owen. You&#x2019;ll definitely find it interesting reading!&#x201d; He waved and strode back toward the front of the library as Owen and Bethany just stared at each other.<br> <br>&#x201c;How did he know our names?&#x201d; Bethany asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;And who could be an old friend of his that we would know?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany glanced at the book Owen was holding. &#x201c;Are you going to look at that one, like he said to?&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen looked down at the cover, then brought it in close to his face, not sure what else to do. It was Kiel Gnomenfoot and the Infinite Reality, the fourth book, where Kiel and Charm tracked down one of the keys to the Source of Magic through parallel universes. He shrugged. &#x201c;It looks like any other book.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bethany took it out of his hands to drop it in the box. &#x201c;His voice sounded a little familiar, but I&#x2019;ve never seen his face. Maybe he&#x2019;s someone we met in a book or something?&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen shook his head. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s impossible. No one can travel between this world and the fictional one anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>She sighed happily. &#x201c;I know, I&#x2019;m the least worried I&#x2019;ve been in my life. Without my fictional self, I don&#x2019;t break rules or jump into books. My mom knows everything about me, and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She trailed off, looking away. &#x201c;I know I don&#x2019;t have Dad still, and that makes me sad. But you said he was okay when you last saw him, and I can&#x2019;t imagine anything happened to him after that, not since Nobody got his way. What would be the point of fighting anymore?&#x201d; She brightened up a bit. &#x201c;So really, everything worked out okay in the end, and now we&#x2019;re safe from my fictional self and her craziness. And there&#x2019;s no way that&#x2019;s going to change!&#x201d;<br> <br>Owen opened his mouth to agree, only to pause as the air between them began to spark, little electric fireworks exploding out of nowhere. Owen backed away in surprise, just as a person appeared out of thin air and crashed into Bethany. They both hit the floor hard, but the newcomer was the first one to stand, and Owen&#x2019;s eyes widened as he found himself staring at someone he never expected to see again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Owen!&#x201d; Kara Dox shouted, hugging him tightly. Instantly, a thousand questions filled his mind and a torrent of emotions flooded over him. &#x201c;I made it, finally! You wouldn&#x2019;t believe what I&#x2019;ve gone through to get here!&#x201d; She pulled away and took hold of his hand. &#x201c;You need to come with me right away. I&#x2019;ve seen your future, Owen. If we don&#x2019;t reconnect your world with the fictional one, you&#x2019;re going to die !&#x201d;</p><h2>RePresent Jesus: Rethink Your Version of Christianity and Become More like Christ</h2><p><b>Discover the joy and power of walking in the footsteps of Jesus.</b><br> There is an image of Jesus we often possess in our minds, and there is a Jesus of the Scriptures.

These aspects of Jesus&#x2019;s ministry are obviously essential, but so is His life. Through Christ&#x2019;s death we received forgiveness and reconciliation; however, His life provides us with something that is equally essential: an example.

This dedicated physician has repeatedly gone far beyond the call of duty in his work to spread the truth about integrating the best science-based medical therapies from all medical disciplines (&#34;alternative medicine&#34;). For a full year, he endured economic and physical hardship to work with physicians at the Pasteur Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, where advanced research on photoluminescence was being conducted.

How should I live? What constitutes a <i>good life</i>? What's the role of fate? What's the role of money?

Humans can last days without food. Humans heal so quickly, they pierce holes in themselves or inject ink under their epidermis for fun. Humans will walk for days on broken bones in order to make it to safety. Humans will literally cut off bits of themselves if trapped by a disaster. You would be amazed what humans will do to survive. Or to ensure the survival of others they feel responsible for. That&#39;s the other thing. Humans pack-bond, and they spill their pack-bonding instincts everywhere. Sure it&#39;s weird when they talk sympathetically to broken spaceships or try to pet every lifeform that scans as non-toxic. It&#39;s even a little weird that just existing in the same place as them for long enough seems to make them care about you. But if you&#39;re hurt, if you&#39;re trapped, if you need someone to fetch help? You really want a human. Twelve authors provide their perspectives on human ingenuity and usefulness as we try to find our place among the stars. From battletested to brokenhearted, humans are capable of amazing things. Humans Wanted shows not only what we are, but how awesome we can be.</p><p></p><h2>If You Were an Adjective (Word Fun)</h2><p>Discover the colorful, brilliant, dazzling life of an adjective!

His dream of playing professional basketball seemed a long shot. A really long shot.<br><br>It was 2004, and Stephen was a high school sophomore. His father had played pro basketball and been a star. Steph grew up in North Carolina, close to some of the best college programs in the country, an ideal place to showcase his talent for top NCAA programs. And Steph had passion for basketball, an accurate shot, and a hunger to make it to the NBA.<br><br>But no one took Stephen very seriously. He kept hearing how he was too tiny and skinny to play Division I basketball, the top collegiate level. The NBA seemed truly out of the question. It didn&#x2019;t help that Steph had a boyish look, making him appear even younger than his seventeen years. Big-name schools kept passing on Steph, figuring he couldn&#x2019;t contribute much to their basketball programs.<br><br>Those were the schools that actually knew Steph existed. Most of the best coaches hadn&#x2019;t even heard of Steph; they sure weren&#x2019;t going to recruit him or offer him a scholarship.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even remember seeing him [during his college recruitment process],&#x201d; says Roy Williams, the legendary University of North Carolina coach. &#x201c;I do know when I did see him I thought, &#x2018;Man, he is little.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Earlier in life, Steph seemed to have a lot going for him. Steph&#x2019;s father, Dell Curry, had been a first-round draft pick who&#x2019;d played sixteen years in the NBA for five different teams. A six-foot-four shooting guard, Dell had retired from the NBA after a long career and remains the Charlotte Bobcat&#x2019;s all-time leading scorer and three-point shooter. Steph&#x2019;s mother, Sonya, had been both a basketball and volleyball state champion in high school and played varsity volleyball in college.<br><br>With such a rich athletic tradition in his family, Stephen played and enjoyed a lot of different sports growing up. But basketball was his first love.<br><br>&#x201c;I was a competitive guy,&#x201d; Steph said in an interview on ESPN, &#x201c;but something about basketball and doing what your dad did [made basketball] more of a draw.&#x201d;<br><br>Having a father in the NBA was a thrill, and Steph grew up admiring his dad and his skills on the court. His mother wouldn&#x2019;t let him go to Charlotte&#x2019;s games on school nights, though, worried he&#x2019;d be exhausted the next day and unable to concentrate on his studies. So on weekends, Steph and his younger brother, Seth, attended as many of their father&#x2019;s games as they could. It was exciting seeing the best NBA players up close; it was even more fun watching their father compete against them. Steph and Seth sometimes even got to shoot with Charlotte players during pregame warm-ups.<br><br>In eighth grade, Steph decided to dedicate himself to basketball, determined to follow in his father&#x2019;s footsteps. He began practicing year-round, committing himself to &#x201c;do whatever it took, whatever was necessary, to play in college,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>By the time Steph was a sophomore in high school, however, he ran into an imposing roadblock: He was just too small. Steph stood five foot six and weighed in at a scrawny 125 pounds.<br><br>&#x201c;On every team he ever played on, he was the smallest guy,&#x201d; his father says.<br><br>Steph was so frail that he had to begin his shooting motion well below his waist because he lacked the strength to raise the ball and shoot it from above his head. Steph&#x2019;s father knew there was no way his son could play college ball if he didn&#x2019;t change his approach. Shooting from below the waist makes it far too easy for a defender to swat the ball away. Dell knew college coaches would never recruit a player with that kind of shooting form.<br><br>One day, Dell came to Steph to deliver some unsolicited advice.<br><br>&#x201c;If you want to play in college,&#x201d; Dell said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re going to have to bring [the ball] up and get it above your head.&#x201d;<br><br>Steph was happy with his shot and wasn&#x2019;t sure he needed to make such a dramatic shift. But he eventually understood he had to transform his game if he wanted to play with bigger and better players, as his father told him.<br><br>Given his size, the NBA seemed completely out of the question for Steph, but he still wanted to play college ball, so he agreed to let his father tutor him. Steph took the summer off from his usual activities, even from playing pickup basketball games, to focus on reinventing his jump shot.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t realize how difficult the process would be. All summer long, he and his father practiced and practiced on a hoop in their backyard. But Steph didn&#x2019;t seem to make much progress. Some nights he ended up in tears.<br><br>&#x201c;It was tough for me to watch them in the backyard, late nights and a lot of hours during the day, working on the shot,&#x201d; Seth, Steph&#x2019;s younger brother, told ESPN. &#x201c;They broke it down to the point where he couldn&#x2019;t even shoot at all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had to do rep after rep after rep to the point where he was able to master it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That was a tough summer for him,&#x201d; Dell agrees.<br><br>Steph worked with his father on changing his release point and moving the ball above his head in order to make his shots harder for rivals to block. Steph wasn&#x2019;t very muscular, so it was hard making the transition. But eventually the lessons kicked in, and he began to master the above-the-head shot.<br><br>As they practiced, Dell and Steph developed a unique approach that made his shot both quick and accurate. When most players learn to shoot, they&#x2019;re taught to release the ball as they reach the highest point of their jump. But Steph was learning to shoot on the way up, when he wasn&#x2019;t very far off the ground. By shooting as he was jumping, rather than at the top of his jump like most people did, Steph could release the ball lightning-quick, in as little as 0.3 seconds. That quick-shot technique would give him an advantage over defenders the rest of his life.<br><br>Shooting on the way up rather than at the top of his jump also enabled Steph&#x2019;s shot to take the form of a sharp arc, like a rainbow, making it much easier to swish through the net. Unlike everyone else, Steph&#x2019;s shots came in on a high angle, as if they were on a steep, downward slope to the opening of the basket. It was a distinctive approach he has maintained, more or less the same, throughout his playing career, according to the Wall Street Journal.<br><br>Back at school for his junior year, Steph&#x2019;s hard work began to pay off. That year, he averaged nearly twenty points a game. It also helped that he had a late growth spurt. By the time he graduated high school, Steph was six feet tall and weighed 160 pounds. He&#x2019;d grown half a foot and gained thirty-five pounds in two years. Steph led his team to three conference titles and three play-off appearances and was named an all-state and all-conference player his senior year.<br><br>Steph seemed on the road to greatness and began envisioning himself playing for a nearby college power. &#x201c;Growing up in Tar Heel country, you want to play for Duke, NC State, Carolina, Wake Forest,&#x201d; Steph says.<br><br>Yet none of those famed schools had any interest in Steph. Recruiters thought he was too small and thin to excel at the collegiate level. Steph was developing a sweet stroke from the outside, but he just didn&#x2019;t seem like someone who could create his own shots, deal with bigger defenders in his face, and play in college, at least at the Division I level. Some overlooked high school players excel in Amateur Athletic Union leagues, gaining the attention of colleges through that route, but Steph wasn&#x2019;t an AAU star, either.<br><br>While most of the biggest schools had little interest in Steph, it made sense that his father&#x2019;s alma mater, Virginia Tech, might be willing to offer him a spot on their team. Dell had been one of the school&#x2019;s greatest basketball players after all. And Virginia Tech doesn&#x2019;t usually go deep in NCAA tournaments, so the school often recruits high school players like Steph&#x2014;capable and hardworking but with little chance of becoming NBA stars.<br><br>But even Virginia Tech, which plays in the competitive Atlantic Coast Conference, decided Steph didn&#x2019;t deserve a scholarship. The only way he could play on their team, the school&#x2019;s recruiters said, was if he &#x201c;walked on,&#x201d; or tried out and outplayed someone else to earn a place on the team. They weren&#x2019;t going to guarantee a spot for Steph and wouldn&#x2019;t offer him a scholarship, no matter what his father had done at the school.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think he ever said it,&#x201d; Seth says. &#x201c;But you could tell it hurt him.&#x201d;<br><br>Steph was disappointed, though he tried not to get discouraged, hoping a small school might give him a chance. That summer, Steph focused on refining his game and improving his shot, using the brush-offs as motivation.<br><br><i>The right college and coach will come,</i> he told himself.<br><br>Steph needed someone to believe in him. He found that person in Bob McKillop, the coach of Davidson College, a tiny liberal arts school located twenty minutes north of Curry&#x2019;s home. Coach McKillop knew all the famous universities had passed on Steph, but he had a feeling they were making a big mistake.<br><br>Yet like other coaches and recruiters, Coach McKillop saw the deficiencies in Steph&#x2019;s game.<br><br>&#x201c;He looked thin, frail, and not strong,&#x201d; Coach McKillop says.<br><br>The coach knew something others didn&#x2019;t, though. His son had played Little League baseball with&nbsp;Steph as a ten-year-old, and Coach McKillop got to know Steph, watching him on the field, game after game. He continued to follow Steph closely in high school and knew Steph had special talent.<br><br>That&#x2019;s not what convinced him that Steph could be a star at Davidson, though.<br><br>&#x201c;You could see the character, the poise, the work ethic, toughness, and resiliency,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>Coach McKillop got in touch with Steph and tried to convince him to enroll at Davidson, offering him a full scholarship. Sure, Davidson was tiny, with fewer than two thousands students and an average class of just fifteen. The university was best known for its academics and hadn&#x2019;t won an NCAA tournament game since 1969, let alone any major tournament. But at Davidson, Coach McKillop insisted, Steph could be a difference maker, a player with immediate impact. Trust me and the program, the coach told Steph. Good things will happen, he assured Steph.<br><br>Steph believed in himself and was confident he could enroll in a more famous school and make the basketball team as a walk-on. But even if he managed to make a big-time college team, Steph knew he likely wouldn&#x2019;t get much playing time. Maybe a few minutes here or there in mop-up duty at the end of a blowout. Playing a minor role on a team wasn&#x2019;t what Steph was hoping for, however.<br><br>Coach McKillop was the first college coach to make Steph feel he was wanted and that he could excel in big-time basketball. With that in mind, Steph signed on to go to school at Davidson.<br><br>&#x201c;I could have walked on at an ACC school,&#x201d; Steph says. &#x201c;But I wanted the opportunity to play.&#x201d;<br><br>In his very first collegiate game, Steph got the start at shooting guard, a sign of the confidence Coach McKillop had in him.<br><br>It was a huge mistake.<br><br>The game was against favored Eastern Michigan on their campus, twenty minutes outside of Ann Arbor. Curry and his Davidson teammates fell behind early and trailed by sixteen points at halftime, an early destruction. By halftime, Steph had nine turnovers. He would finish with a humiliating thirteen turnovers in total.<br><br>In the first half, Steph seemed truly out of his league in Division I basketball, just like the college coaches had predicted. In one embarrassing play, Steph handled the ball in the backcourt with defenders swarming around him and lost his footing. Slipping and falling to the court awkwardly, Steph flung the ball to a teammate, only to see an opposing player step in and knock it away. The Eastern Michigan fans cheered wildly, celebrating the ugly mistake. Davidson fans cringed.<br><br>At halftime, even Steph&#x2019;s coach had second thoughts about him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m rethinking whether he belongs in the starting lineup,&#x201d; Coach McKillop remembers contemplating.<br><br>In spite of his reservations, Coach McKillop decided to leave Steph in for the second half, hoping he might settle down. Smart move. Almost immediately, Steph and his team began to rally. Instead of acting discouraged or scared after the awful first half, Steph called for the ball, camping out on the three-point line and begging teammates to feed him the rock. Steph began knocking down threes, one after another, becoming more confident with each bucket. He quieted the hostile crowd and led Davidson to an improbable comeback victory.<br><br>It was an early sign of Steph&#x2019;s self-assurance and tenacity.<br><br>The next night, against an even more imposing University of Michigan team, Steph really went off. He scored thirty-two points, dished out four assists and even snatched nine rebounds.<br><br>Steph finished his freshman year as the leading scorer in the Southern Conference, averaging 21.5 points per game, second in the nation among freshman, just behind University of Texas forward Kevin Durant, the future NBA superstar. Steph also broke the freshman season record for three-point field goals.<br><br>One day that year, Coach McKillop spotted Steph&#x2019;s parents in the airport and walked over, making a prediction: &#x201c;Your son will earn a lot of money playing this game one day.&#x201d;<br><br>Dell Curry was skeptical. A great college shooter is one thing. Making it at the pro level is a whole different ball game. Even though he&#x2019;d had a late growth spurt, Steph was still short and slight, especially compared with guys in the NBA. Guarding big, muscular players in the pros seemed improbable. As far as Dell was concerned, Steph&#x2019;s chances of succeeding in the NBA, or even getting drafted by a team, weren&#x2019;t very strong; Coach McKillop&#x2019;s prediction seemed foolish.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking, &#x2018;Yeah, maybe [he&#x2019;ll have a chance to play] overseas,&#x2019;&#x201d; Dell Curry says.<br><br>But Steph kept growing, reaching six foot three inches by his sophomore year in college. And he continued to perfect his shot. On March 21, 2008, Steph and Davidson played in the NCAA tournament. With his parents in the stands and a national audience glued to their television screens, Steph dropped an astounding forty points on Gonzaga University, shooting an astonishing eight for ten from the three-point range, leading Davidson to its first NCAA men&#x2019;s basketball tournament win since 1969. Two days later, Steph burned heavily favored Georgetown University, the nation&#x2019;s eighth-ranked team, for thirty points in another upset victory.<br><br>His parents watched from the stands, absolutely stunned. Steph was evolving from a good player into a great one before their eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you believe that?&#x201d; Dell asked his wife.<br><br>They were so shocked they drove home from the game in silence, Steph&#x2019;s mother, Sonya, recalls.<br><br>During that year&#x2019;s tournament, Steph became a household name around the country, becoming only the fourth player in history to average at least thirty points in his first four NCAA tournament games and leading Davidson to the Elite Eight, where the team lost to the top-seeded and eventual champion Kansas Jayhawks.<br><br>&#x201c;He changed from him being Dell&#x2019;s son to Dell being Steph&#x2019;s father,&#x201d; Seth says.<br><br>Steph&#x2019;s eye-turning performance on the national stage had transformed the way he was viewed in the basketball world and beyond. After the NCAA tournament ended, his parents saw up close how much Steph&#x2019;s life and career had transformed in just a few days. At a Charlotte home game, they watched as fans mobbed Steph, as if he was a rock star.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s how I knew things had changed,&#x201d; Sonya says.</p><h2>Born to Ice</h2><p>SeaLegacy co-founder, National Geographic photographer, acclaimed ocean conservationist, and TED Talks favorite, Paul Nicklen traces his extraordinary love affair with the polar regions in his most recent book, Born to Ice.

He racked up well over 80,000 sea miles doing it, mostly single-handed. Why? You&#x2019;ll find some interesting answers in his book of stories, <i>Margarita Cat</i>, but essentially, he did it because he <i>liked</i> doing it.</p><p>Sailing up and down the chain of islands so much and so often, he got to looking for shorter and easier ways to navigate between each link in the chain, and he kept refining detailed nav plans for every leg.</p> <p>He has systematically taken the thorns out of the route they used to call the <i>Thorny Path</i>. For example, he exploits the calming effects on wind and sea which result from land cooling on each side of an inter-island passage. Applying his many methods, both sail and power can make safe, comfortable and pleasant progress even against normally impenetrable trade winds and seas.</p> <p><i>Passages South</i> offers an illustrated manual of instruction for specific passages and harbors down islands as well as a cruising guide for the Greater Antilles islands of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. It has sailed aboard tens of thousands of boats passaging between the Americas. It should sail with you too.</p></p><p>Orphaned by World War II, Van Sant worked his way through childhood at dozens of crazy jobs. He learned to sail early by borrowing sailing skiffs from beach lifeguards. After university he got a sailboat with a plan that, when the sailboats got big enough, he'd get out of the rat race and go sailing to simpler places for a simpler life. After a decade in aerospace IT he spent four decades of cruising, working as a consultant systems engineer and writing and speaking in countries of Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East, picking up six languages along the way. Returning to the Americas in 1979 he settled into cruising the myriad islands between Florida and South America. Having long ago "copped out" or "gone Galt", Van Sant got used to living freely, without every step insured or hobbled by cat's cradles of regulations, government programs, monthly bills and nettling bosses. He lived without ever-present signs of "NO smoking", "NO fishinig", "No swimming, loitering, littering, entry, passing, parking in the park &#x2014; NO!". If you want to escape, he can tell you how. You can read some of his and others' adventures in world cruising in his book MARGARITA CAT. Van Sant has, alas, sold his last boat and lives ashore with his wife Rosa in their home, Kembali ke Tanah, high over the sea in the Dominican Republic.

Delicate lines with simple watercolor shading and patterns keep the small tableaux simple, but they&#x2019;re vivid with life from the multicultural cast of bouncy kids and the evocation of life&#x2019;s sensory encounters, from the homely smell of baby poo to the glorious vision of fireworks.

The essay was published in French in 1850. This piece was published in English as part of Essays on Political Economy (G.P. Putnams &amp; Sons, 1874) with authoritative translation by British economist Patrick James Stirling.</p></p><p>Frederic Bastiat, who was born two hundred years ago, was a leader of the French laissez-faire tradition in the first half of the nineteenth century.

She remains furious with him for his abrupt departure last summer but has done her best to move on with her life at college in Chicago &#x2015; and she's finally over Tyler...right?&nbsp;As school breaks up for the summer, she's heading back to Santa Monica, but she's not the only one who decides to come home...&nbsp;</p><p>Despite their breakup, Tyler's determined to rekindle what they once had.

I'm Estelle Maskame and I write the DIMILY trilogy! I'm a total bookworm and YA addict, not to mention a hopeless romantic. I've always adored books and writing while growing up, and all throughout primary school I loved to write stories about talking dolphins and pirate ships. Admittedly, I've moved away from the eight-year-old fantasy genre and now focus on writing YA romance.<br><br>I grew up in a small town called Peterhead in the North-east of Scotland, and I belong to a huge fishing family! My favourite things include books, hot chocolate (with cream and marshmallows, of course), road trips, new clothes, my best friends, and chicken nuggets.

Vera B. Williams died on October 16, 2015, shortly before this book was completed. </p>Kindergarten-Grade 2 Bidemmi, a young black child, draws splendid pictures. "As she draws, she tells the story of what she is drawing," always starting with the word "this." Bidemmi's brightly colored words and pictures introduce children to the man with the nice face that's dark brown; to the tiny, white, grandmotherly lady; and to the tall boy who is much like Bidemmi's own brother. Finally, Bidemmi tells her story, revealing her wish for her neighborhood and her world. Each story involves cherriesbuying, sharing, and enjoying them. The man with the nice face shares them with his children, the tiny lady with her parrot, the tall boy with his little sister. Bidemmi will eat her cherries and then plant the pits, nourish them, watch them grow, and share the fruit with people from all over the neighborhood. Williams uses a first-person narrator to tie these tales together. Very different styles of illustration further define who is speaking. Soft, beautifully-crafted watercolors depict Bidemmi as the narrator speaks. As Bidemmi herself tells her stories, fresh, child-like, highly detailed illustrations done in lustrous colored markers are used. Well formated text and illustrations complement, enhance, and extend each other. All together, this is a fresh and imaginative book which exudes a respect for and understanding of children. Maria B.

He is the author of eleven previous novels, including the best-selling <i>Nature Girl, Skinny Dip, Sick Puppy,</i> and <i>Lucky You,</i> and three best-selling children's books, <i>Hoot, Flush, </i>and <i>Scat. </i>His most recent work of nonfiction is <i>The Downhill Lie: A Hacker's Return to a Ruinous Sport.</i> He also writes a weekly column for <i>The Miami Herald.</i>1<br><br>On the fifteenth of March, two hours before sunrise, an emergency medical technician named Jimmy Campo found a sweaty stranger huddled in the back of his ambulance. It was parked in a service alley behind the Stefano Hotel, where Jimmy Campo and his partner had been summoned to treat a twenty-two-year-old white female who had swallowed an unwise mix of vodka, Red Bull, hydrocodone, birdseed and stool softener&#x2014;in all respects a routine South Beach 911 call, until now.<br><br>The stranger in Jimmy Campo&#x2019;s ambulance had two 35-mm digital cameras hanging from his fleshy neck, and a bulky gear bag balanced on his ample lap. He wore a Dodgers cap and a Bluetooth ear set. His ripe, florid cheeks glistened damply, and his body reeked like a prison laundry bag.<br><br>&#x201c;Get out of my ambulance,&#x201d; Jimmy Campo said.<br><br>&#x201c;Is she dead?&#x201d; the man asked excitedly.<br><br>&#x201c;Dude, I&#x2019;m callin&#x2019; the cops if you don&#x2019;t move it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s with her up there&#x2014;Colin? Shia?&#x201d;<br><br>The stranger outweighed Jimmy Campo by sixty-five pounds but not an ounce of it was muscle. Jimmy Campo, who&#x2019;d once been a triathlete, dragged the intruder from the vehicle and deposited him on the sticky pavement beneath a streetlight.<br><br>&#x201c;Chill, for Christ&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; the man said, examining his camera equipment for possible damage. Stray cats tangled and yowled somewhere in the shadows.<br><br>Inside the ambulance, Jimmy Campo found what he was looking for: a sealed sterile packet containing a coiled intravenous rig to replace the one that the female overdose victim had ripped from her right arm while she was thrashing on the floor.<br><br>The stranger struggled to his feet and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you a thousand bucks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When you bring her downstairs, lemme take a picture.&#x201d; The man dug into the folds of his stale trousers and produced a lump of cash. &#x201c;You gotta job to do, and so do I. Here&#x2019;s a grand.&#x201d;<br><br>Jimmy Campo looked at the money in the stranger&#x2019;s hand. Then he glanced up at the third floor of the hotel, where his partner was almost certainly dodging vomit.<br><br>&#x201c;Is she famous or somethin&#x2019;?&#x201d; Jimmy Campo asked.<br><br>The photographer chuckled. &#x201c;Man, you don&#x2019;t even know?&#x201d;<br><br>Jimmy Campo was thinking about the fifty-two-inch high-def that he&#x2019;d seen on sale at Brands Mart. He was thinking about his girlfriend on a rampage with his maxed-out MasterCard at the Dadeland Mall. He was thinking about all those nasty letters from his credit union.<br><br>&#x201c;Whoever she is, she&#x2019;s not dead,&#x201d; he told the photographer. &#x201c;Not tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cool.&#x201d; The man continued to hold out the wad of hundreds in the glow of the streetlight, as if teasing a mutt with raw hamburger. He said, &#x201c;All you gotta do, before loading her in the wagon, just pull down the covers and step away so I can get my shot. Five seconds is all I need.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It won&#x2019;t be pretty. She&#x2019;s a sick young lady.&#x201d; Jimmy Campo took the crumpled money and smoothed it into his wallet.<br><br>&#x201c;Is she awake at least?&#x201d; the photographer asked.<br><br>&#x201c;On and off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you could see her eyes in a picture, right? She&#x2019;s got those awesome sea-green eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>Jimmy Campo said, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t notice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You really don&#x2019;t know who she is? Seriously?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who do you work for, anyway?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A limited partnership,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;Me, myself and I.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And where can I see this great picture you&#x2019;re gonna take?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everywhere. You&#x2019;ll see it everywhere,&#x201d; the stranger said.<br><br>Eighteen minutes later, Jimmy Campo and his partner emerged from the Stefano Hotel guiding a collapsible stretcher upon which lay a slender, motionless form.<br><br>The photographer was surprised at the absence of a retinue; no bodyguards or boyfriends or hangers-on. A lone Miami Beach police officer followed the stretcher down the alley. When the photographer began snapping pictures, the cop barely reacted, making no effort to shield the stricken woman from the flash bursts. That should have been a clue.<br><br>Sliding closer, the paparazzo intercepted the stretcher as it rolled with an oscillating squeak toward the open end of the ambulance. True to his word, Jimmy Campo tugged down the sheet and stepped away, leaving an opening.<br><br>&#x201c;Cherry!&#x201d; the photographer shouted at the slack face. &#x201c;Cherry, baby, how &#x2019;bout a big smile for your fans?&#x201d;<br><br>The young woman&#x2019;s incurious eyes were open. They were not sea-green, mint-green, pea-green or any hue of green. They were brown.<br><br>&#x201c;Goddammit,&#x201d; the photographer growled, lowering his Nikon.<br><br>The woman on the stretcher grinned behind the oxygen mask and blew him a kiss.<br><br>Grabbing at Jimmy Campo&#x2019;s arm, the photographer cried, &#x201c;Gimme back my money!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mister, I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about,&#x201d; said the paramedic, elbowing the sweaty creep back into the shadows.</p><h2>Sharing the Wisdom of Time</h2><p><b>2019 Illumination Book Awards, Gold in Keepsake/Gift/Specialty Bible</b><br><br> A collection of personal stories in which grandparents and elders from around the world share from their &#x201c;reservoirs of wisdom&#x201d; to inspire and guide.<br><br> We have all heard that the only constant in life is change.

From a blind basket weaver in Kenya to an acclaimed filmmaker in Hollywood, from a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp to a centenarian midwife in Guatemala, every story is a testament to the power of faith, perseverance, human resilience, and love.<br> &nbsp;<br> The experience and lived wisdom of our grandparents and elders can guide the leaders of tomorrow to move forward creatively and confidently as they envision a future of hope. The testimony of our elders will help us to look above the horizon and see the stars.</p><p><b>POPE FRANCIS&nbsp;</b>was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio on 17 December 1936 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a young man, he worked briefly as a chemical technician and nightclub bouncer before entering the Jesuits. He was ordained a priest in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979, was Argentina's Provincial Superior of the Society of Jesus. He became the Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998, and was appointed a Cardinal in 2001.&nbsp;Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013, Bergoglio was named his successor on 13 March. He chose the name Francis in honor of Saint Francis of Assisi. He is the first Jesuit Pope, the first Pope from the Americas, the first Pope from the Southern Hemisphere, and the first non-European Pope in over 1200 years. Pope Francis has been noted for his humility, his concern for the poor, and his commitment to dialogue as a way to build bridges between people of all backgrounds, beliefs, and faiths.<br><br></p><h2>The Best Loved Villages of France</h2><p>An insider&#x2019;s tour of France&#x2019;s most beloved and beautiful villages uncovers the country&#x2019;s hidden treasures.

The authors provide readers with multiple representations of each concept, as well as ways to implement these ideas in the classroom. I particularly appreciate the authors' focus on what we want students to learn and do, how we know if they have learned those things, and what we do from there-not only <i>if</i> students have not learned those things, but also what do we do next if students learn what we want them to learn.

As a cognitive scientist she is intent on understanding the minds of animals who cannot say what they know or feel. This is a fresh look at the world of dogs - from the dog&#39;s point of view.</p><p>Alexandra Horowitz is the author of the bestselling Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell and Know. She teaches psychology, animal behaviour and canine cognition at Barnard College, Columbia University. She earned her PhD in Cognitive Science at the University of California. She lives in New York City with her husband, the writer Ammon Shea, her son, and two dogs.<b>Prelude</b> <p></p><i><br>First you see the head. Over the crest of the hill appears a muzzle, drooling. It is as yet not visibly attached to anything. A limb jangles into view, followed in unhasty succession by a second, third, and fourth, bearing a hundred and forty pounds of body between them. The wolfhound, three feet at his shoulder and five feet to his tail, spies the long-haired Chihuahua, half a dog high, hidden in the grasses between her owner&#x2019;s feet. The Chihuahua is six pounds, each of them trembling. With one languorous leap, his ears perked high, the wolfhound arrives in front of the Chihuahua. The Chihuahua looks demurely away; the wolfhound bends down to Chihuahua level and nips her side. The Chihuahua looks back at the hound, who raises his rear end up in the air, tail held high, in preparation to attack. Instead of fleeing from this apparent danger, the Chihuahua matches his pose and leaps onto the wolfhound&#x2019;s face, embracing his nose with her tiny paws. They begin to play.</i> <p>For five minutes these dogs tumble, grab, bite, and lunge at each other. The wolfhound throws himself onto his side and the little dog responds with attacks to his face, belly, and paws. A swipe by the hound sends the Chihuahua scurrying backward, and she timidly sidesteps out of his reach. The hound barks, jumps up, and arrives back on his feet with a thud. At this, the Chihuahua races toward one of those feet and bites it, hard. They are in mid-embrace&#x2014;the hound with his mouth surrounding the body of the Chihuahua, the Chihuahua kicking back at the hound&#x2019;s face&#x2014;when an owner snaps a leash on the hound&#x2019;s collar and pulls him upright and away. The Chihuahua rights herself, looks after them, barks once, and trots back to her owner. </p><p>These dogs are so incommensurable with each other that they may as well be different species. The ease of play between them always puzzled me. The wolfhound bit, mouthed, and charged at the Chihuahua; yet the little dog responded not with fright but in kind. What explains their ability to play together? Why doesn&#x2019;t the hound see the Chihuahua as prey? Why doesn&#x2019;t the Chihuahua see the wolfhound as predator? The answer turns out to have nothing to do with the Chihuahua&#x2019;s delusion of canine grandeur or the hound&#x2019;s lack of predatory drive. Neither is it simply hardwired instinct taking over. </p><p>There are two ways to learn how play works&#x2014;and what playing dogs are thinking, perceiving, and saying: be born as a dog, or spend a lot of time carefully observing dogs. The former was unavailable to me. Come along as I describe what I&#x2019;ve learned by watching. </p><p>I am a dog person. </p><p>My home has always had a dog in it. My affinity for dogs began with our family dog, Aster, with his blue eyes, lopped tail, and nighttime neighborhood ramblings that often left me up late, wearing pajamas and worry, waiting for his midnight return. I long mourned the death of Heidi, a springer spaniel who ran with excitement&#x2014;my childhood imagination had her tongue trailing out of the side of her mouth and her long ears blown back with the happy vigor of her run&#x2014;right under a car&#x2019;s tires on the state highway near our home. As a college student, I gazed with admiration and affection at an adopted chow mix Beckett as she stoically watched me leave for the day. </p><p>And now at my feet lies the warm, curly, panting form of Pumpernickel&#x2014;<i>Pump</i>&#x2014;a mutt who has lived with me for all of her sixteen years and through all of my adulthood. I have begun every one of my days in five states, five years of graduate school, and four jobs with her tail-thumping greeting when she hears me stir in the morning. As anyone who considers himself a dog person will recognize, I cannot imagine my life without this dog. </p><p>I am a dog person, a lover of dogs. I am also a scientist. </p><p>I study animal behavior. Professionally, I am wary of anthropomorphizing animals, attributing to them the feelings, thoughts, and desires that we use to describe ourselves. In learning how to study the behavior of animals, I was taught and adhered to the scientist&#x2019;s code for describing actions: be objective; do not explain a behavior by appeal to a mental process when explanation by simpler processes will do; a phenomenon that is not publicly observable and confirmable is not the stuff of science. These days, as a professor of animal behavior, comparative cognition, and psychology, I teach from masterful texts that deal in quantifiable fact. They describe everything from hormonal and genetic explanations for the social behavior of animals, to conditioned responses, fixed action patterns, and optimal foraging rates, in the same steady, objective tone. </p><p>And yet. </p><p>Most of the questions my students have about animals remain quietly unanswered in these texts. At conferences where I have presented my research, other academics inevitably direct the postlecture conversations to their own experiences with their pets. And I still have the same questions I&#x2019;d always had about my own dog&#x2014;and no sudden rush of answers. Science, as practiced and reified in texts, rarely addresses our experiences of living with and attempting to understand the minds of our animals. </p><p>In my first years of graduate school, when I began studying the science of the mind, with a special interest in the minds of non-human animals, it never occurred to me to study dogs. Dogs seemed so familiar, so understood. There is nothing to be learned from dogs, colleagues claimed: dogs are simple, happy creatures whom we need to train and feed and love, and that is all there is to them. There is no <i>data</i> in dogs. That was the conventional wisdom among scientists. My dissertation advisor studied, respectably, baboons: primates are the animals of choice in the field of animal cognition. The assumption is that the likeliest place to find skills and cognition approaching our own is in our primate brethren. That was, and remains, the prevailing view of behavioral scientists. Worse still, dog owners seemed to have already covered the territory of theorizing about the dog mind, and their theories were generated from anecdotes and misapplied anthropomorphisms. The very notion of the mind of a dog was tainted. </p><p>And yet. </p><p>I spent many recreational hours during my years of graduate school in California in the local dog parks and beaches with Pumpernickel. At the time I was in training as an ethologist, a scientist of animal behavior. I joined two research groups observing highly social creatures: the white rhinoceros at the Wild Animal Park in Escondido, and the bonobos (pygmy chimpanzees) at the Park and the San Diego Zoo. I learned the science of careful observations, data gathering, and statistical analysis. Over time, this way of looking began seeping into those recreational hours at the dog parks. Suddenly the dogs, with their fluent travel between their own social world and that of people, became entirely unfamiliar: I stopped seeing their behavior as simple and understood. </p><p>Where I once saw and smiled at play between Pumpernickel and the local bull terrier, I now saw a complex dance requiring mutual cooperation, split-second communications, and assessment of each other&#x2019;s abilities and desires. The slightest turn of a head or the point of a nose now seemed directed, meaningful. I saw dogs whose owners did not understand a single thing their dogs were doing; I saw dogs too clever for their playmates; I saw people misreading canine requests as confusion and delight as aggression. I began bringing a video camera with us and taping our outings at the parks. At home I watched the tapes of dogs playing with dogs, of people ball- and Frisbee-tossing to their dogs&#x2014;tapes of chasing, fighting, petting, running, barking. With new sensitivity to the possible richness of social interactions in an entirely non-linguistic world, all of these once ordinary activities now seemed to me to be an untapped font of information. When I began watching the videos in extremely slow-motion playback, I saw behaviors I had never seen in years of living with dogs. Examined closely, simple play frolicking between two dogs became a dizzying series of synchronous behaviors, active role swapping, variations on communicative displays, flexible adaptation to others&#x2019; attention, and rapid movement between highly diverse play acts. </p><p>What I was seeing were snapshots of the minds of the dogs, visible in the ways they communicated with each other and tried to communicate with the people around them&#x2014;and, too, in the way they interpreted other dogs&#x2019; and people&#x2019;s actions. </p><p>I never saw Pumpernickel&#x2014;or any dog&#x2014;the same way again. Far from being a killjoy on the delights of interacting with her, though, the spectacles of science gave me a rich new way to look at what she was doing: a new way to understand life as a dog. </p><p>Since those first hours of viewing, I have studied dogs at play: playing with other dogs and playing with people. At the time I was unwittingly part of a sea change taking place in science&#x2019;s attitude toward studying dogs. The transformation is not yet complete, but the landscape of dog research is already remarkably different than it was twenty years ago. Where once there was an inappreciable number of studies of dog cognition and behavior, there are now conferences on the dog, research groups devoted to studying the dog, experimental and ethological studies on the dog in the United States and abroad, and dog research results sprinkled through scientific journals. The scientists doing this work have seen what I have seen: the dog is a perfect entry into the study of non-human animals. Dogs have lived with human beings for thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of years. Through the artificial selection of domestication, they have evolved to be sensitive to just those things that importantly make up our cognition, including, critically, attention to others. </p><p>In this book I introduce you to the science of the dog.

Molly Moon struggles to survive in Hardwick House, an orphanage apparently run by and for caricatures--the beastly mistress Miss Adderstone and her bad-tempered pug, the muscly Gordon Boils (who tattooed "KING GORD" on the fingers of his fists with a compass and ink), creepy Roger Fibbin with his "sharp nose and cold, spying eyes." But as all wish-fulfillment adventures must go, Molly's life is changed one fateful day, as an arcane book draws out her special talent--she can hypnotize anybody to do anything she wants!</p><p> </p><p> Byng makes good use of her otherwise mundane cast with plenty of wry asides (like Molly's fixation on the transformative promise of advertising), great running jokes (especially the metamorphosis of the orphanage's hard-boiled cook into a proud Italian <i>capocuoco</i>), some clever plot sleight-of-hand, and ample funny descriptions (as when Molly finds herself in the Royal Suite at the Waldorf: "She wasn't sure about the Jacuzzi. It was like ten monsters farting in her bath all at once."). (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><p>Georgia Byng grew up by the river Itchen in Hampshire, England, in a large family.

Though Nora had traveled the world, she remained in New York no matter her physical location. Her New York&#x2013;ness wrapped around her like a protective gauze, even here at a funeral in the Grosse Pointe Memorial Church. The place was more beautiful, somehow, than Liberty had expected, with its white stone walls, Tudor arches, and ornate stained-glass windows. It felt at least a hundred years old. A comfort, somehow.<br> <br>&#x201c;I should hope so,&#x201d; Leo said, flashing a smile at an older woman who had her eyes glued to him as she passed the pew toward the back where the three Lawrence siblings had settled in, Liberty futilely hoping they could keep a low profile. &#x201c;I mean, the day I don&#x2019;t stand out from a crowd like this? Euthanasia, I beg you.&#x201d; Leo was Nora&#x2019;s twin (Leonardo and Leonora: they were named after royalty and so they behaved), though they hardly resembled each other.<br> <br>&#x201c;Leo.&#x201d; Liberty shot him a warning look.<br> <br>&#x201c;A joke,&#x201d; he whispered back. &#x201c;Trying to lighten the mood.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The mood is meant to be somber, Leo. Just . . . please.&#x201d; Liberty wrapped her arms tighter around herself and faced forward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry. Jesus.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that her?&#x201d; Nora said, leaning over Leo&#x2019;s lap toward Liberty, who was sitting on the aisle.<br> <br>Liberty looked up as a young woman (she was twenty-three, the same age as the twins) walked by to the front pew that was reserved for family. Laila&#x2014;their cousin, a stranger, the person they had come to see&#x2014;seemed to be the only person in the church who hadn&#x2019;t noticed the three of them. Though this was the first time they would meet, Liberty recognized her immediately. She was distinctive: petite and lovely, with green eyes and long red hair. She was fine-boned (as Liberty and her siblings were) and appeared delicate to the point of breakable against the backdrop of the sturdy midwesterners who surrounded her.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s her.&#x201d;<br> <br>She clung to the arm of a tall, broad-shouldered man who was wearing a suit that appeared made for someone much smaller, the lip of his boxy white shirt peeking out from the bottom of his jacket as he moved&#x2014;could this really be her boyfriend? He looked like a high school jock who&#x2019;d gone to seed but had failed to notice. Laila appeared to be in a fog, eyes straight ahead as she made her way to the pew. Liberty wondered if she&#x2019;d taken a sedative to get through her mother&#x2019;s funeral. In her Internet scouring, she&#x2019;d not been able to find much information on Laila. A Facebook profile, of course, and some photos of her on the website of a local high-end cosmetic dentist&#x2019;s office. At first, Liberty thought she might be a model&#x2014;and was struck by the irony of this, that her faraway midwestern cousin would be a model just as she and her own mother had been&#x2014;but upon further inspection, it appeared that Laila worked at the office. They&#x2019;d simply taken advantage of having such a comely staff member by putting her front and center on the website. She was not a dentist, it seemed; perhaps a hygienist or receptionist.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s so weird that they both went in car accidents, so many years apart,&#x201d; Leo said. Their uncle&#x2014;their father&#x2019;s brother&#x2014;had died thusly thirteen years before. The two families had grown up estranged from each other. Now Laila was an orphan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tragic,&#x201d; Nora said. &#x201c;Dickensian,&#x201d; she added dramatically.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is our actual plan here?&#x201d; Leo asked. He was clearly losing patience with the whole idea, which at the outset, he&#x2019;d found amusing enough. He was bored now and wanted to be back in Manhattan. Organ music boomed through the church and Liberty hushed her brother. The service was beginning.<br> <br>Betsy Lawrence was eulogized by her older sister, Jennifer, a short, round woman with whispers of Laila&#x2019;s green-eyed wholesome prettiness. It was a strange speech, containing nothing specific about Betsy herself or what the world had lost in her passing. &#x201c;?&#x2018;The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable,&#x2019;?&#x201d; she quoted from Corinthians. &#x201c;?&#x2018;It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.&#x2019; And so Betsy goes home to the Lord. I know my niece Laila wanted to speak about her mother today. I know she loved her dearly. But the shock . . . I&#x2019;m afraid . . .&#x201d; She was twisting a tissue in her hands and appeared overcome, standing at the pulpit as though she had no idea how she&#x2019;d gotten there. After a moment, a man (her husband?) came to collect her, draping his arm around her and shepherding her off the stage. It was an odd moment, but then, it was a funeral. The Lawrence siblings had not been to many&#x2014;only their grandmother&#x2019;s and an older family friend or two.<br> <br>The service was brief, and before long, the organ was once again sounding its dirge, and people were standing up and filing out. Before Liberty could come up with a plan, the three of them were pulled along in a tide of people to the church basement where the reception was being held. It was an altogether more modern and sterile space than the grandeur of the hall above, fit for Sunday school and AA meetings. There was subdued string music playing, and officious church ladies were ferrying a large spread&#x2014;tea, cookies, various hot dishes, and, mercifully, several bottles of wine. Now that the funeral-goers were no longer restrained by the pews, they gawked openly at the Lawrence siblings.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this the mom?&#x201d; Nora said, picking up one of several framed photos arranged on the table closest to the door. The shot was of a young woman who, if not for the teased hair and color-block 1980s sweater, could have easily been mistaken for Laila.<br> <br>&#x201c;Must be,&#x201d; Liberty said. &#x201c;God, Laila&#x2019;s a dead ringer.&#x201d;<br> <br>They made their way down the line of photos. Even Leo was hushed by seeing these images of the family that had been kept from them. Liberty felt tears coming to her eyes when she got to her aunt and uncle&#x2019;s wedding photos from twenty-five years earlier. She could see so much of her father in his younger brother&#x2019;s face, a man she&#x2019;d supposedly met but had no clear memories of.<br> <br>Their father, Ben Lawrence, never spoke of his brother, Gregory. He&#x2019;d been gone now thirteen years and all Liberty knew had been gleaned from the occasional overheard conversation in her childhood and what she could discover online, which was not much more than the basics: her uncle had owned a number of luxury car dealerships throughout Michigan, and he and his wife had one daughter, Laila, who was the same age as the twins. Liberty was seventeen when her uncle died; her father hadn&#x2019;t been an especially warm man to begin with, and the death of his brother had made him even more remote, causing him to retreat further into his work. Repeated searches yielded little more, but Liberty set up a Google Alert with Laila&#x2019;s name, which was how she&#x2019;d discovered Betsy&#x2019;s recent death. And that had brought them here.<br> <br>The three of them moved on to the food and drinks. Liberty poured red wine into the small, sad plastic cups for each of them. Nora examined the food from a distance, as though even coming near it might make her fat. There were piles of cookie bars with numerous layers and frostings, great platters of potato salad with what appeared to be hot dogs mixed in, several varieties of mac and cheese.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is so weird,&#x201d; Nora said, taking a sip of her wine and peering around at the men in their khakis and the women whose collective bulk was covered in many layers of scarves and cardigans. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s . . . America.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like a TLC show or something,&#x201d; Leo added.<br> <br>Liberty rolled her eyes and just at that moment felt a hand on her elbow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br> <br>She turned and the glassy green eyes of her cousin looked up at her. She was small, a half foot shorter than Liberty at least. There was something familiar about her still: the nose, the set of her eyes; she was a stranger, but she was their family.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to be rude,&#x201d; Laila said hesitantly, &#x201c;but who are you? This is my mother&#x2019;s funeral.&#x201d;<br> <br>Liberty felt sick to her stomach. A moment before, she&#x2019;d been contemplating telling her siblings that they should just leave, get in touch later. But now it was too late for that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um . . . oh. I&#x2019;m Liberty, and this is Leo and Nora.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nora&#x2014;who didn&#x2019;t have good boundaries on her best day&#x2014;flung herself at her unsuspecting cousin, who blankly accepted her into her arms. &#x201c;You poor thing! We just had to come.&#x201d;<br> <br>Liberty gently pulled her sister away from Laila, who was now smiling nervously.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; She looked at them as though searching for clues. &#x201c;But who are you? Why are you here?&#x201d;<br> <br>The siblings quickly glanced at each other, amazed. Their names had triggered nothing; she knew even less than they did.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d; Liberty weighed the option of coming up with some alternate cover story so as not to distract from the occasion, which their visit seemed certain to do. She dismissed this. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re your cousins. Ben is our dad.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked incredulous. &#x201c;Ben doesn&#x2019;t have kids,&#x201d; Laila said uncertainly, as if she was asking a question. For a moment the three siblings were quiet, because they hadn&#x2019;t precisely been told about Laila either. Liberty had eavesdropped and eventually told the twins.<br> <br>&#x201c;He does,&#x201d; Leo said at last, his voice kind. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Laila continued to stare at them uncomprehendingly. A moment later, the man she was with&#x2014;her fianc�, although their engagement was still a secret&#x2014;appeared at her side. Liberty watched him subtly lock on her brother as though thinking, Oh thank goodness, a man.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nathan Jansen,&#x201d; he said, introducing himself to Leo with a hearty handshake.<br> <br>&#x201c;Leo Lawrence,&#x201d; he smiled with relish as surprise came over the man&#x2019;s pale features.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m Nora Lawrence.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Liberty,&#x201d; she followed as Nathan&#x2019;s eyes ricocheted over to her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lawrence? As in . . .&#x201d; He looked over at Laila.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re her cousins,&#x201d; Liberty said, feeling suddenly helpless.<br> <br>Laila turned to him, still bewildered. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Oh, why had they come? Liberty was mortified to ever be the cause of drama. And at a funeral! Tacky.<br> <br>&#x201c;We just came to pay our respects, and actually, we&#x2019;d probably better get going. Laila, you can call me anytime.&#x201d; Liberty pressed a card into her hand, adding, &#x201c;My cell is on there. And I would love to hear from you.&#x201d; Liberty began to shepherd her siblings in the direction of the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; Laila said. &#x201c;Where are you staying?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Atheneum.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. I&#x2019;ll call you later, maybe,&#x201d; Laila said, before being pulled away by funeral-goers who had been waiting nearby.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;It is so messed up that her parents didn&#x2019;t even tell her we existed.&#x201d; Nora leaned her head wearily on her brother&#x2019;s shoulder. They were fitted snuggly in the back of a town car, three across for the twenty-minute drive along the Lake Shore Road to their hotel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, our parents didn&#x2019;t tell us about her either, at least not willingly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think Beau knows about her?&#x201d;<br> <br>Liberty shrugged. Of the three of them, she was closest with their eldest half brother, Beau, but she didn&#x2019;t hear from him for months at a time and hadn&#x2019;t told him about their trip. He lived in Banff, a tiny town near Alberta, Canada.<br> <br>&#x201c;Beau barely speaks to Dad, so I don&#x2019;t know that he would have made the effort to get to know Laila even if he did. I&#x2019;ll ask him whenever he reappears, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s really pretty. I wonder why she lives here,&#x201d; Nora said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, she grew up here,&#x201d; Leo said, &#x201c;and at least the neighborhood is nice. Look at the houses. We could practically be in Connecticut.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But that guy she was with. Was that really her boyfriend?&#x201d; Nora pulled at the waistband of her dress. Her clothes were always a size too small, as though she imagined herself thinner when she bought them.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Liberty said, &#x201c;it seemed that way.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nora made a face.<br> <br>Just then Liberty felt her phone buzz with a text message.<br> <br>Hi Liberty - it&#x2019;s Laila. When are you leaving? I thought we might meet up tomorrow. Would it be okay if it was just you and me though? I&#x2019;m feeling overwhelmed.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just Reece checking in.&#x201d; Liberty felt strangely protective of Laila. She thought of her standing there next to her boyfriend in the church, looking fragile and faraway. Was that strange aunt with the Bible verses the only family she had left?<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe we have to spend the night in Detroit,&#x201d; Nora said as they were getting out of the car.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nora, hush,&#x201d; Liberty said, feeling the eyes of the hotel&#x2019;s doorman on them. She smiled at him warmly and his expression said that she, at least, was forgiven.<br> <br>&#x201c;I like it here,&#x201d; Leo said, just to be contrary. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so much edgier than New York, so much more real. And this hotel,&#x201d; he said, stretching his arms wide, smiling up at the dramatic frescos and expanse of marble that engulfed the lobby, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s like Vegas or something.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or something,&#x201d; Nora muttered.<br> <br>&#x201c;My good man!&#x201d; Leo said, strolling up to the concierge desk where a thin twentysomething who swam in his dark suit lifted his gaze from his computer.<br> <br>&#x201c;How can I help you, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me,&#x201d; Leo said, leaning over the counter, his convivial charm working on the young man, &#x201c;where should we go for dinner? We&#x2019;re only in town for a night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; the concierge said, straightening his spine, &#x201c;were we thinking fine dining or . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, God, no,&#x201d; Leo said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you imagine what passes for fine dining in this hellhole?&#x201d; Nora said under her breath to Liberty, who gave her a sharp look.<br> <br>&#x201c;Something authentic,&#x201d; Leo said, &#x201c;what&#x2019;s your favorite spot?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Pizza okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have pizza in New York,&#x201d; Nora said, &#x201c;amazing pizza.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not like this,&#x201d; the concierge said, &#x201c;I promise you. No one has pizza like Papalis.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m intrigued,&#x201d; Leo said. &#x201c;Girls?&#x201d;<br> <br>They both nodded, Liberty smiling, Nora sulking as the concierge showed Leo the restaurant&#x2019;s location on a map.<br> <br><br> <br>They were seated in a booth toward the front of Papalis as Leo watched other patrons as if they were performing a cabaret for his amusement. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like being on safari! I should write about this in my column,&#x201d; he said, meaning his weekly missive for New York magazine&#x2019;s Man About Town where he mostly chronicled the parties he went to&#x2014;he&#x2019;d even sold a book to a publisher off the concept.<br> <br>When their pizza arrived, it was a monstrous thing, like five pizzas crammed together and covered with extra cheese and sauce.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ugh,&#x201d; Nora said, &#x201c;no wonder everyone here is so fat.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This actually smells pretty delicious,&#x201d; Liberty said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m ordering a salad,&#x201d; Nora said, &#x201c;if they even have such a thing here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Leo said, taking a generous bite of his slice and rolling his eyes in ecstasy, &#x201c;God, this is good.

He shows how the long history of Shintoism is deeply woven into the fabric of Japanese spirituality and mythology--indeed, it is regarded as Japan&#x2019;s very spiritual roots--and discusses its role in modern Japan and the world. He also carefully analyzes the relationship of the spirit and the soul, which will provide informed and invaluable insight into how spirituality affects our daily existence. Through the author&#x2019;s emphasis on the universality of Shinto and its prevalence in the natural world, the book will appeal to all readers with an appreciation of humanity&#x2019;s place in nature and the individual&#x2019;s role in the larger society.</p><p><b>MOTOHISA YAMAKAGE</b> was born in 1925 and brought up in an old Shintoist family. At the age of eighteen he was initiated into the mysteries of Shinto, and in 1956 became the 79th Grand Master of Yamakage Shinto. Grand Master Yamakage has played a leading role in introducing Shinto to people around the world. Many of his essays, translated into German, French, and English, have been published in leading European magazines. In 2005, Motohisa Yamakage retired and was succeeded by his son, Hitoyoshi Yamakage.Western visitors to Japan sometimes come away with the idea that Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, is a "dead" tradition, with shrines preserved as mere historic sites or tourist traps. Not so, claims Yamakage, who represents "the 79th generation of an ancient Shinto tradition" and makes a case for living Shinto as a faith-based religion that is predicated on "the belief in the presence of the <i>kami</i>," or spirits. Yamakage calls for a return to <i>koshinto</i>, the ancient Shinto practice that he says had no shrines at all, and for a rejection of the "secular, materialistic, atheistic society" that he believes modern Japan has become. He offers a strong introduction to Shinto, stressing that it is nondogmatic, nondoctrinal and almost wholly decentralized. Still, Shintoists are united by a reverence for nature and an emphasis on self-purification, particularly through water rituals and cleansing. The book is nicely designed, with an excellent layout and black-and-white photos throughout. At times, Yamakage's voice can be overly strident, as when challenging the faith and motivations of some contemporary Shinto priests. Overall, however, this is a fine primer that makes a compelling case for Shinto as a religion invested with deep meaning. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Professor of phonetics Henry Higgins makes a bet that he can train a bedraggled Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, to pass for a duchess at an ambassador&#39;s garden party by teaching her to assume a veneer of gentility, the most important element of which, he believes, is impeccable speech. The play is a sharp lampoon of the rigid British class system of the day and a commentary on women&#39;s independence. In ancient Greek mythology, Pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures, which then came to life. The general idea of that myth was a popular subject for Victorian era English playwrights, including one of Shaw&#39;s influences, W. S. Gilbert, who wrote a successful play based on the story called Pygmalion and Galatea first presented in 1871. Shaw also would have been familiar with the burlesque version, Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed. Shaw&#39;s play has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the musical My Fair Lady and the film of that name.</p><p></p><h2>The Dhammapada (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>One of the best-known and best-loved works of Buddhist literature, the <i>Dhammapada </i>forms part of the oldest surviving body of Buddhist writings, and is traditionally regarded as the authentic teachings of the Buddha himself, spoken by him in his lifetime, and memorized and handed on by his followers after his death.

Paris - the most beautiful city in the world! The most romantic! It's the perfect place for a girl and her grandad to spend the day. Join them as they explore Paris's iconic landmarks and experience its culture and style first-hand: visit a traditional street market, climb to the top of Notre-Dame, wander through the Tuileries Gardens and gaze up at the Eiffel Tower. Salvatore Rubbino's friendly text and fresh, lively illustrations beautifully capture the delight of a young visitor experiencing the wonders of Paris - the City of Lights<br></p><p>Salvatore Rubbino is a rising talent in the world of illustration. His first book for children, A Walk in New York, was shortlisted for the V&amp;A Illustration Awards, his second, A Walk in London, won an SLA Information Book Award, and his third, Just Ducks!

He lives in London, E15.Similar in approach to Rubbino&#x2019;s A Walk in New York City (2009) and A Walk in London (2011), this large-format picture book follows a girl and her grandfather as they tour Paris together. From the market at Place Maubert, they stroll the boulevards to Place Saint-Michel and cross the River Seine to Notre-Dame Cathedral. After a bistro lunch, they pass by the Pompidou Center, the Louvre, and into the Tuileries Gardens. As darkness falls, they watch a light show at the Eiffel Tower, a fitting end to their day. Each double-page spread offers at least one new view of Paris, from a broad cityscape to a close-up of pastries in a shop window. Supplementing the journey story, notes in tiny type carry additional information. A stylized, highly simplified map of Paris appears on the front endpapers, while on the back, the same map is strewn with tickets, coins, souvenirs, and a brief index. Mixed-media illustrations capture the feel of the city while retaining Rubbino&#x2019;s breezy and highly appealing style. Pure pleasure for armchair travelers.

Judge, to which verse numbers have been added. Romanized Sanskrit terms have been updated to modern IAST standards, except for three deviations meant to aid in proper pronunciation. The Voice of the Silence represents a collection of fragments from an ancient and unknown text called "The Book of the Golden Precepts". It outlines the two paths of spiritual enlightenment: the first, the path of spiritual selfishness, where the goal is one's own escape from suffering; and the second, the path of spiritual altruism, where the goal is to give oneself wholly to uplifting all of humanity. This second path is called the path of the Bodhisattva and is modeled on the Buddha's teachings. It is to encourage the few true mystics in this world to adopt this path of unselfish and unceasing service to humanity that the Voice of the Silence was written. Those interested in such a path will find all they need to start their journey in this little book.

With their combined resources and determination they seek a lost fortune in stolen diamonds. The treasure's dark history is matched by the fanaticism of an influential environmental terrorist. Narrator Scott Brick is well suited for this testosterone-laced tale of tough guys. His voice projects barely restrained intensity, like a street-fighter looking for any excuse to start throwing punches. Unfortunately, Brick's British and African accents are not as strong as his solid narration of the main characters.

Eleven-year-old Hunter Scott was watching <i>Jaws</i> one day when he first heard about the World War II sinking of the USS Indianapolis. Intrigued, he investigated further, and discovered a shocking, heartbreaking story behind what should have been a tale of heroism and patriotism. Torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, the Indianapolis went down in minutes, taking more than 800 sailors with it. Several hundred survived, but only after spending days in the open sea with sharks diminishing their numbers hourly. This is only the beginning of the tragedy, however. In an effort to make an example of the ship's captain, and in order to deflect blame from itself, the U.S. Navy unfairly court-martialed the captain, painfully changing the lives of all the men involved.<p> Basing much of his text on young Hunter Scott's research, author Pete Nelson does a fine job of presenting this story through the eyes of many of the survivors. Old and new photos allow readers to know many of the men of the ship, and personal accounts reveal the horrors of those days in the ocean--and later in the courtroom. A bittersweet ending will leave the reader pensive and deeply moved. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Just after midnight on July 30, 1945, the USS &#34;Indianapolis was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. The ship sank in 14 minutes. More than 1,000 men were thrown into shark-infested waters. Those who survived the fiery sinking--some injured, many without life jackets--struggled to stay afloat in shark-infested waters as they waited for rescue. But the United States Navy did not even know they were missing. The Navy needed a scapegoat for this disaster. So it court-martialed the captain for &#34;hazarding&#34; his ship. The survivors of the &#34;Indianapolis knew that their captain was not to blame. For 50 years they worked to clear his name, even after his untimely death. But the navy would not budge--until an 11-year-old boy named Hunter Scott entered the picture. His history fair project on the &#34;Indianapolis soon became a crusade to restore the captain&#39;s good name and the honor of the men who served under him.</p><h2>The Nutcracker: The Original 1853 Edition With Illustrations</h2><p><p>Sometimes you just want to have the original.&nbsp; This is one of the earliest known English translation of E.T.A.

Using engaging stories and personal experience, Edward Sri helps us understand the classical view of morality and equips us to engage relativism, appealing to both the head and the heart. Learn how Catholic morality is all about love, why making a judgment is not judging a person's soul, and why, in the words of Pope Francis, "relativism wounds people."

He lives in Vermont.Following their Baby Duck's New Friend, the father-and-son team offers a rollicking testament to the excitement whipped up by the wind. A girl watching a golden leaf swept away on the breeze exclaims, "I want to play like a windy day." The girl, the leaf and the wind (depicted as a cavorting, childlike apparition shown in profile, its facial contours matching the girl's) frolic across the pages. The girl's rhyming speech pays homage to their antics ("I want to zoom down hillsides/ and race through streets./ I want to scatter seeds,/ turn windmills,/ fly kites,/ wave flags,/ and snap wet sheets"). Here, the wind stretches out its hand to turn a windmill while the girl does a cartwheel and clasps a dandelion whose seeds billow in the gust. Brisk, digitally colorized pen-and-ink drawings include sundry background details (e.g., an upended trash can, laundry billowing on the line between two buildings, etc.).

Mr. Egielski lives in Milford, New Jersey, with his wife and son.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3-- A deceptively simple story about seven small wooden dolls (a grandma, a boy and his parents, a dog, a doctor, and a policeman). They coexist with people, first as objects for bathtime and then, after the boy gets stuck in the drain, as windowsill decorations. But there's a spookiness, a surreality about the manner of their interactions that invites readers to use them allegorically. The temptation to perceive the actions of these dolls as a family set in a political state that severely limits their lives is strong. Egielski's crisply delineated, deceptively simple scenes create a visual world that adds considerably to the surrealism. There is no question about the inanimateness of these slickly painted, clothespinlike figures. But--with dots and a few lines as facial clues, can we be "reading" their thoughts? Close-ups are used to make a reasonably scaled world for these figures. Thus patterns of shadows, soap foam, quilt, and tools are blown up to take on new identities. Pictures and words interact in ways that magnetize readers, causing them to linger over a page and to turn back to test a theory of meaning. --Kenneth Marantz, Art Education Department, Ohio State University, Columbus<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beatrix Potter: A Life in Nature</h2><p><p>In this now classic biography, reissued in a new edition for the 150th anniversary of Beatrix Potter's birth, Linda Lear offers the astonishing portrait of an extraordinary woman who gave us some of the most beloved children's books of all time.

Have you sat through inspiring sermons about what is possible when Christians gather together in mutually edifying relationships, only to recognize how cynical you have become after many failed attempts? Community may be one of the most over-promised, under-delivered aspects of the Christian life today. Individuals remain selfish and stuck in their ways. Communities become spiritually lifeless or even fall apart because we don't know how to experience transformation together. Transforming community does not come primarily from listening to inspiring preaching or adding another church program. It emerges as we embrace a shared commitment to the attitudes, practices and behaviors that open us to Christ in our midst. And that s where <em>Life Together in Christ</em> comes in.

America&#39;s Symbols, Landmarks, and Important Words</h2><p><b>This picture book celebrates and explains America's symbols, landmarks, and important words in lively, brief text and bright, humorous illustrations.</b><br><br>There are stars-and-stripes T-shirts. There are Statue of Liberty pencil sharpeners and Uncle Sam Halloween costumes. Patriotic symbols are everywhere...but where do they come from? What do they mean?<br>Now in paperback, this celebration of twenty of America's important places, interesting objects, and inspiring words is for the youngest Americans. Including Plymouth Rock, the White House, the flag, the bald eagle, and many more, this book draws kids in with its big, two-page spreads and fun, bright pastels and satisfies their curiosities about America's most prominent symbols.</p><p>Sheila Keenan is the author of many nonfiction books, including GREETINGS FROM THE 50 STATES; ANIMALS IN THE HOUSE; O, SAY CAN YOU SEE?; GODS, GODDESSES, AND MONSTERS; and the SCHOLASTIC ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES. She lives in New York City.Grade 1-5&#x2013;From Independence Hall to Uncle Sam, this colorful book presents a mostly lighthearted look at familiar symbols of the United States, describing places, objects, treatises, and American holidays. Most of the subjects are given double-page treatments. Featuring soft edges and textured shading, the pastel and colored-pencil illustrations highlight details presented in the narrative. For example, a man is shown chiseling souvenir pieces from Plymouth Rock while his companion catches the bits in her apron. Asides help move the text along, as when a "Ding-dong THUNK!!" is heard when the Liberty Bell is rung with an off-key sound. Cool factoids are the rule here as well (e.g., on Mount Rushmore, Washington's nose is 20 feet long). The section on the Pledge of Allegiance mentions the "Under God" controversy. Myths are dispelled: "There is no proof that George Washington asked Betsy Ross...to sew the first [flag]." While most descriptions are lengthy and contain enough detail for reports, the holidays are dismissed in single paragraphs. On the final page, the World Trade Center is described as a national symbol, because remembering "...lets us turn an act of hate into a symbol of hope." The list for further reading is current, with most titles written after 2000. More in-depth and upbeat than Delno C. and Jean M. West's <i>Uncle Sam and Old Glory</i> (Atheneum, 2000), Keenan's title is a fine choice for libraries.<i>&#x2013;Anne Chapman Callaghan, Racine Public Library, WI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

D., author of <i>Love, Medicine &amp; Miracles</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p>Newly revised and updated to address the increased stress of our modern times, <i>Slowing Down to the Speed of Life </i>by bestselling author Richard Carlson (<i>Don&#x2019;t Sweat the Small Stuff...and It&#x2019;s All Small Stuff</i> and <i>Don&#x2019;t Get Scrooged</i>)<i> </i>and Joseph Bailey is the classic guide to creating a more peaceful, simpler life from the inside out. With practical and easy exercises to help you slow down your mind and focus on the present moment, <i>Slowing Down to the Speed of Life</i>, in the words of Dan Millman, bestselling author of <i>Way of the Peaceful Warrior</i>, is &#x201c;a life-enhancing book with insightful principles for peaceful and productive living at work and at home.&#x201d;</p><p>This is the book for you if you've ever had the urge to tell off your boss, quit your job, hurl your Palm Pilot into the trash, and move to a farm. Written by bestselling stress consultant and psychotherapist Dr. Richard Carlson <i>Don't Sweat the Small Stuff</i>, it advocates the cultivation of a personal mindfulness and "thought navigation" to foster a sense of mental calmness and increased creativity and productivity.<p> With sage tips reminiscent of those in Jon Kabat-Zinn's <i>Wherever You Go, There You Are</i>, Carlson recommends a "Psychology of Mind" approach that involves being fully present in each situation and not letting the attitudes of others ruin your day. This way, your thoughts become more organized--wiser, if you will--and you get more work done without even trying. This time management trick is what he says will improve your life--not a cell phone or an electronic scheduler or a personal assistant. Carlson's advice can be taken to heart, as he's used these techniques to improve his own life. While he was working on his Ph.D., he rose at 4 a.m. and "gulped down ten or fifteen cups of coffee" each day just to get all his work done, and would bristle if family emergencies took him away from his studying.</p><p> Not only does Carlson promise to help boost one's productivity, but he says that relationships and intimacy will improve as well. He maintains that disagreements--at home or at work--are less likely to blow up into full-fledged arguments if you're being calm and levelheaded. "A mind operating at the speed of life can see things as they really are," he writes. "Slowing down gives you needed perspective during times of transition and stress. When you operate at the speed of life and your child desires privacy, you'll probably remember that almost all teenagers go through phases of wanting space from their parents....Rather than take it personally, you'll be able to see the bigger picture. If your mind is moving too quickly, events as well as your own thoughts about events become much larger than they really are." </p><p> For anyone fed up with life's chaos, <i>Slowing Down to the Speed of Life</i> should prove to be an immensely helpful mental health manual. <i>--Erica Jorgensen</i></p>Ever notice that the faster you go, the "behinder" you get? Ever feel like while your life is full--maybe too full--of things to do, you aren't enjoying life nearly enough? Want a way off the treadmill of anxiety, worry and pressure, and into real happiness? <i>In Slowing Down to the Speed of Life</i>, Richard Carlson and Joseph Bailey show you how to create a more peaceful, simpler life from the inside out. In the authors' words: <p>"This is a book about slowing down to learning to live in the moment. We are not, however, going to ask to change your lifestyle. You don't have to move to the country or to a small town in another state. You don't have to resign from your job or change your career." </p><p>"In this book, you will learn to slow down your life from the inside out. This change will result from a wiser way of being in the world, not from superficially reorganizing the externals of your life. You will discover how your quality of life is created within rather than imposed upon you by outside forces." </p><p>Carlson and Bailey help us recognize rushed thought processes and access healthy, relaxed feelings and, using the popular "psychology of mind" approach, they teach us to gain new-found abilities to stay focused on the task at hand, and enhance our creativity and achievement. Illustrated with useful exercises, charts and diagrams, as well as inspiring personal reflections, <i>Slowing Down to the Speed of Life</i> shows us how to maintain a healthy calm in the midst of life's storm.</p></p><h2>The Case Interview: 20 Days to Ace the Case: Your Day-by-Day Prep Course to Land a Job in Management Consulting</h2><p><p></p><p><b>Game-changing tips and tricks to nail the case interview and launch your consulting career.</b></p><p></p><p>Management consultants Destin Whitehurst and Erin Robinson give you need-to-know techniques for polishing your poise and tightening your case interview skills. <em>20 Days to Ace the Case Interview</em> preps you with the nuts and bolts of the case interview process with daily exercises, mock interviews, and industry know-how designed to help you ace your interview.</p> <p>Think of this book as your twenty-day intensive, management consulting boot camp, the perfect supplement to your arsenal of case interview lessons and material.</p> <p>With this guidebook, you will:</p><ul> <li><b>Gain day-by-day structure:</b> Daily case interview exercises progressively prep you</li><li><b>Ask the right questions:</b> Fundamental frameworks teach you exactly what to ask under pressure</li> <li><b>Learn from the pros:</b> Review real-life stories from consulting experts</li><li><b>Uncover unique strategies:</b> Discover custom-developed case interview tips straight from the authors</li><li><b>Go off script:</b> Adapt what you&#x2019;ve learned with our bonus case interview guides</li> </ul></p><p>Destin Whitehurst is the President of Consulting Interview Coach LLC, which provides case interview preparation and coaching services to aspiring consultants worldwide.

The authors show readers how to identify, assess, and track the knowledge, specific skills, broad attitudes, and human values that undergird a series of professional competencies spanning the breadth of clinical practice. Case examples illuminate the supervisory give-and-take as trainees develop competence in areas such as professional values, sensitivity to individual and cultural differences, ethical and legal standards, self-care, scientific knowledge and methods, applying evidence-based practice, and more. From practicum, to internship and general practice, the competency-based approach offers clear training goals that organize and focus the supervisor&#x2019;s attention where it&#x2019;s needed most. This book also includes dialogue from the authors&#x2019; supervision session with a real trainee as shown in the DVD Competency-Based Supervision.</p><p><b>Carol A.

Masterful.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>Washington Post</em></strong></p><p>The arsons started on a cold November midnight and didn&#x2019;t stop for months. Night after night, the people of Accomack County waited to see which building would burn down next, regarding each other at first with compassion, and later suspicion. Vigilante groups sprang up, patrolling the rural Virginia coast with cameras and camouflage. Volunteer firefighters slept at their stations. The arsonist seemed to target abandoned buildings, but local police were stretched too thin to surveil them all. Accomack was desolate&#x2015;there were hundreds of abandoned buildings. And by the dozen they were burning.</p><p>&#x201c;One of the year&#x2019;s best and most unusual true-crime books&#x201d; (<em>Christian Science Monitor</em>), <em>American Fire</em> brings to vivid life the reeling county of Accomack. &#x201c;Ace reporter&#x201d; (<em>Entertainment Weekly</em>) Monica Hesse spent years investigating the story, emerging with breathtaking portraits of the arsonists&#x2015;troubled addict Charlie Smith and his girlfriend, Tonya Bundick. Tracing the shift in their relationship from true love to crime spree, Hesse also conjures the once-thriving coastal community, decimated by a punishing economy and increasingly suspicious of their neighbors as the culprits remained at large. Weaving the story into the history of arson in the United States, the critically acclaimed American Fire re-creates the anguished nights this quiet county lit up in flames, evoking a microcosm of rural America&#x2015;a land half-gutted before the fires began.</p> 8 pages of illustrations</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2017:</strong> A passionate love affair is often described as an &#x201c;inferno,&#x201d; but in 2012 and 2013, boyfriend and girlfriend Charlie Smith and Tonya Bundick turned the metaphor into reality as they lit 70-plus fires in derelict buildings across Virginia&#x2019;s Accomack County. Monica Hesse&#x2019;s spare but memorable prose sketches the true story of a once-prosperous county now in sharp economic decline, its derelict buildings easy targets for Smith and Bundick. But Accomack County&#x2019;s plunging fortunes is the simplistic explanation for the arson epidemic, and Hesse pushes that aside to plumb the complicated personal relationships, the tight-knit community, and the stories told in small towns that can shape a person&#x2019;s destiny just as surely as one&#x2019;s actions. When Smith and Bundick set fire after fire&#x2014;sometimes several a night&#x2014;the exhausted volunteer firefighters in Accomack County band together to stop the arsonists putting a match to their way of life. Hesse can do with a handful of words what other writers do with paragraphs, and as she traces the intersecting paths of the amateur arsonists and the authorities determined to capture them, she reveals that every crime has its own personal, sometimes inscrutable DNA. <em>--Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review</em>Monica Hesse is a feature writer for the Washington Post. &nbsp;Winner of the Edgar Award and a finalist for a Livingston and James Beard Award, she is also the author of Girl in the Blue Coat.

No longer the exclusive preserve of pure mathematicians, it is now proving itself to be a powerful tool in science, informatics, and industry. By facilitating communication between communities and building rigorous bridges between disparate worlds, applied category theory has the potential to be a major organizing force. This book offers a self-contained tour of applied category theory. Each chapter follows a single thread motivated by a real-world application and discussed with category-theoretic tools. We see data migration as an adjoint functor, electrical circuits in terms of monoidal categories and operads, and collaborative design via enriched profunctors. All the relevant category theory, from simple to sophisticated, is introduced in an accessible way with many examples and exercises, making this an ideal guide even for those without experience of university-level mathematics.</p><p>Category theory reveals commonalities between structures of all sorts.

While the plot is unique, the story feels too far-fetched to be believable, and lacks the magic of Grabenstein's Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library (Random, 2013).&#x2014;Michele Shaw, Quail Run Elementary School, San Ramon, CA</p><h2>My Craziest Adventures With God - Volume 1: The Supernatural Journal of a Former Atheist Paramedic</h2><p>Does God speak today?

They can collapse in an instant&#x2014;when consent is withdrawn.This is the thesis of this thrilling book. Murray Rothbard writes a classic introduction to one of the great political essays in the history of ideas.In times when dictators the world over are falling from pressure from their own people, this book, written nearly 500 years ago, is truly the prophetic tract of our times.�tienne de La Bo�tie was born in Sarlat, in the P�rigord region of southwest France, in 1530, to an aristocratic family, and became a dear friend of Michel de Montaigne. But he ought to be remembered for this astonishingly important essay, one of the greatest in the history of political thought. It will shake the way you think of the state. His thesis and argument amount to the best answer to Machiavelli ever penned as well as one of the seminal essays in defense of liberty.La Bo�tie's task is to investigate the nature of the state and its strange status as a tiny minority of the population that adheres to different rules from everyone else and claims the authority to rule everyone else, maintaining a monopoly on law. It strikes him as obviously implausible that such an institution has any staying power. It can be overthrown in an instant if people withdraw their consent.He then investigates the mystery as to why people do not withdraw, given what is obvious to him that everyone would be better off without the state. This sends him on a speculative journey to investigate the power of propaganda, fear, and ideology in causing people to acquiesce in their own subjection. Is it cowardice? Perhaps. Habit and tradition. Perhaps. Perhaps it is ideological illusion and intellectual confusion.La Bo�tie goes on to make a case as to why people ought to withdraw their consent immediately. He urges all people to rise up and cast off tyranny simply by refusing to concede that the state is in charge.The tyrant has "nothing more than the power that you confer upon him to destroy you. Where has he acquired enough eyes to spy upon you, if you do not provide them yourselves? How can he have so many arms to beat you with, if he does not borrow them from you? The feet that trample down your cities, where does he get them if they are not your own? How does he have any power over you except through you? How would he dare assail you if he had no cooperation from you?"Then these inspiring words: "Resolve to serve no more, and you are at once freed. I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over, but simply that you support him no longer; then you will behold him, like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away, fall of his own weight and break in pieces."In all these areas, the author has anticipated Jefferson and Arendt, Gandhi and Spooner, and those who overthrew Soviet tyranny. The essay has profound relevance for understanding history and all our times.As Rothbard writes in his spectacular introduction, "La Boetie's Discourse has a vital importance for the modern reader&#x2014;an importance that goes beyond the sheer pleasure of reading a great and seminal work on political philosophy, or, for the libertarian, of reading the first libertarian political philosopher in the Western world. For La Bo�tie speaks most sharply to the problem which all libertarians&#x2014;indeed, all opponents of despotism&#x2014;find particularly difficult: the problem of strategy. Facing the devastating and seemingly overwhelming power of the modern State, how can a free and very different world be brought about? How in the world can we get from here to there, from a world of tyranny to a world of freedom? Precisely because of his abstract and timeless methodology, La Bo�tie offers vital insights into this eternal problem."</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Pit Bull: The Battle over an American Icon</h2><p><b>The controversial story of one infamous breed of dog--a <i>New York Times </i>Bestseller ("Animals" list).</b><br><br>When Bronwen Dickey brought her new dog home, she saw no traces of the infamous viciousness in her affectionate pit bull. Which made her wonder: How had the breed&#x2014;beloved by Teddy Roosevelt and Helen Keller&#x2014;come to be known as a brutal fighter? Dickey&#x2019;s search for answers takes her from nineteenth-century New York dogfighting pits to early twentieth-century movie sets, from the battlefields of Gettysburg to struggling urban neighborhoods. In this illuminating story of how a popular breed became demonized--and what role humans have played in the transformation--Dickey offers us an insightful view of Americans' relationship with their dogs.</p><p><b>BRONWEN DICKEY</b>&nbsp;is an essayist and journalist who writes regularly for the <i>Oxford American</i>. Her work has also appeared in&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>Slate, The Best American Travel Writing 2009</i>,&nbsp;<i>Newsweek,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Outside,</i>&nbsp;among other publications. In 2009 she received a first-place Lowell Thomas Travel Journalism Award and a MacDowell Colony residency grant. She lives in North Carolina.<b>Pariah Dogs</b><br><br><i>&#x201c;The animal has secrets which, unlike the secrets of</i><br><i>&nbsp;caves, mountains, seas, are specifically addressed to man.&#x201d;</i><br>&#x2014;John Berger, &#x201c;Why Look at Animals?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>On a hot summer day a few years ago, my husband brought home a slightly underweight thirty-eight-pound pit bull with a caramel-and-white coat, a flesh-colored nose, and eyes the color of honey. Carved cheekbones and a cleft in the top of her head gave her face the shape of a small but eager heart. Sean and I nearly passed her by when we drove out to our local animal shelter to look around days before. &#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; he said, pointing to the shy, trembling animal as I cooed over a flashier candidate. &#x201c;What about this one?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>We did not need another dog. We had been married less than a year and we still didn&#x2019;t know how best to shape our independent selves to the contours of a shared life. Sean worked long hours at a local hospital and I spent weeks at a time traveling on reporting assignments. Our imperious black pug named Oscar had finally gotten to the age where we no longer worried about leaving him alone in the house for more than an hour. Not worrying was a pastime I had come to enjoy. Any new addition, not to mention one twice Oscar&#x2019;s size, would upend our lives for a while.<br><br>So, why did it we do it? I&#x2019;m still not quite sure. I can&#x2019;t say that this little pit bull stared at me, but she never looked away, either.&nbsp;<br><br>In his classic essay &#x201c;Why Look at Animals?&#x201d; the critic John Berger writes that the look between man and animal is a bridge between our species and theirs, one of the few that can be built between two creatures that do not share a common language. &#x201c;The animal scrutinises [man] across a narrow abyss of non-comprehension,&#x201d; he writes. When man looks back, however, there is an added layer: Man, says Berger,&nbsp; &#x201c;is always looking across ignorance and fear.&#x201d;<br><br>I came to appreciate the profound truth of Berger&#x2019;s words when I told those closest to me that the new dog we had decided to bring home was a pit bull. Even if they hadn&#x2019;t encountered a pit bull, everyone knew (or thought they knew) the pit bull&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>story,</i>&nbsp;which to them was one of human bloodlust, mysterious fighting genes, and uncontrollable canine rage. So many aspects of our culture&#x2014;from our metaphors (the terms &#x201c;top dog&#x201d; and &#x201c;underdog&#x201d; originated in the fighting pits), to our music, to our consumer goods, to our politics&#x2014;reinforce the stereotypes. When vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin joked during her 2008 acceptance speech that the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull was lipstick, the audience laughed knowingly. The great irony of the indelible mark the pit bull has left on our society is that even those who valorize the story&#x2014;who proudly call themselves pit bull politicians, pit bull lawyers, pit bull reporters&#x2014;in essence vilify the actual dog at the center of it.&nbsp;<br><br>As for my pit bull, a dog-rescuer friend shook her head. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t do it,&#x201d; she said solemnly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t trust those dogs. They will turn on you. And once that switch is turned on, there&#x2019;s no turning it off.&#x201d; Like the media, which regularly trumpeted the sordid details of pit bull attacks on humans, my friends framed the issue in terms of strict dichotomies:&nbsp;<i>Are pit bulls dangerous, or are they misunderstood? Are they born vicious, or is it all in how you raise them? Which is stronger: Nature or Nurture?&nbsp;</i>Like the existence of God or the ethics of capital punishment, the &#x201c;truth&#x201d; about pit bulls makes for lively debates. But always, underneath my friends&#x2019; quailing, was a revealing division: Pit bulls weren&#x2019;t for people like &#x201c;us.&#x201d; Pit bulls belonged to&nbsp;<i>them.<br></i><br>*<br><br>For the better part of two hundred years, the history of bull-and-terrier dogs was illustrious, rather than infamous. Advertisers across the United&nbsp;States clamored to use pit bulls in their campaigns during the 1920s, not because the dogs were believed to be menacing, but because they were thought to be so friendly and appealing to the &#x201c;average Joe.&#x201d; They are the only dogs to have appeared on the cover of Life magazine three times, for example. The animals&#x2019; widespread popularity among people of all ages, races, and classes owed much to their reputations as plucky, unfussy sidekicks and hardy all-purpose workers. More than that, however, &#x201c;the dog with the patch over his eye&#x201d; was seen as quintessentially American: good-natured, brave, resilient, and dependable. By World War I, pit bulls were so beloved as national symbols that we literally and figuratively wrapped them in the flag. We even called them &#x201c;Yankee terriers.&#x201d;<br><br>Haphazardly classified under almost twenty other names over the years, bull-and-terrier dogs marched onto the field at the Battle of Gettysburg and sniffed out snipers at Normandy. They peeked out of covered wagons bound for California and stumped for women&#x2019;s suffrage. One greeted visitors at New York City&#x2019;s first pizzeria in 1907, while another lived in Teddy Roosevelt&#x2019;s White House. They also accompanied us into the brave new world of modern technology, listening to &#x201c;his master&#x2019;s voice&#x201d; on the recently invented gramophone and riding shotgun in the first cross-country road trip by automobile.<br><br>Cultural icons as diverse as Sir Walter Scott, William &#x201c;Buffalo Bill&#x201d; Cody, Anna Pavlova, Helen Keller, Jack Dempsey, Jack Johnson, Andy Devine, Roscoe &#x201c;Fatty&#x201d; Arbuckle, Gary Cooper, Douglas Fairbanks, James Thurber, Theodor &#x201c;Dr. Seuss&#x201d; Geisel, and Jimmy Carter proudly kept bull-and-terrier dogs as pets, and years before anyone heard of a German shepherd named Rin Tin Tin, pit bull actors ruled the silver&nbsp;screen. In fact, &#x201c;Rinty&#x201d; only appeared in 27 motion pictures, while a pit bull named Pal the Wonder Dog appeared in 224.<br><br>Then, in the 1970s, like a bright light snapping off, everything went terribly wrong. The crime of dogfighting exploded in the headlines, and the well-intentioned, well-publicized crusade to stamp out a barbaric but moribund form of animal torture unwittingly made it more popular. Once reporters and misinformed activists cast the dogs as willing participants in their own abuse, pit bulls were exiled to the most turbulent margins of society, where a cycle of poverty, violence, fear, and desperation had already created a booming market for aggressive dogs. Headlines about pit bull attacks on humans multiplied. Within a few short years, America&#x2019;s century-old love for its former mascot gave way to the presumption that pit bulls were biologically hardwired to kill.</p><h2>Sophocles&#39; Antigone: A New Translation</h2><p>Sophocles&#39; Antigone comes alive in this new translation that will be useful for both academic study and stage production. Diane Rayor&#39;s accurate yet accessible translation reflects the play&#39;s inherent theatricality. She provides an analytical introduction and comprehensive notes, and the edition includes an essay by director Karen Libman. Antigone begins after Oedipus and Jocasta&#39;s sons have killed each other in a battle over the kingship. The new king, Kreon, decrees that the brother who attacked with a foreign army remain unburied and promises death to anyone who defies him. The play centers on Antigone&#39;s refusal to obey Kreon&#39;s law and Kreon&#39;s refusal to allow her brother&#39;s burial. Each acts on principle colored by gender, personality, and family history. Antigone poses a conflict between passionate characters whose extreme stances leave no room for compromise. The highly charged struggle between the individual and the state has powerful implications for ethical and political situations today.</p><p>Sophocles&#39; Antigone comes alive in this new translation that will be useful for both academic study and stage production.

It covers all aspects of marine sanitation as well as other odor-causing problems like dirty bilge areas in an easy to understand format. The focus is to instruct the reader on how to resolve odor problems, not just disguise them. In addition there are extensive appendices providing detailed contact information on equipment manufacturers and schematics of most major brands and models of marine toilets that will allow the reader to make necessary repairs with a high degree of confidence. This second edition contains many new schematics not found in the original book. &#34;The New Get Rid of Boat Odors&#34; is a book for boat owners or professionals in the boat industry alike. It&#39;s the most comprehensive guide available to help solve the widespread problem of annoying odors on boats.</p><p>Peggie Hall is nationally recognized in the boating industry as one of the few experts in marine sanitation, and is often referred to as &#34;the Head Mistress.&#34; She has written a number of articles for major boating magazines, is often asked to speak at conferences and conduct seminars for various organizations and at major boat shows, and has been a consultant to a number of state agencies. For more than 20 years she also hosted plumbing and sanitation forums on many online boating sites, beginning even before the internet as we know it today existed with the Sailing Forum on CompuServe. She first entered the marine business in 1987, when she formed Peal Products, which was the first company in the marine industry to focus exclusively on onboard sewage management issues and the elimination of odors on boats. In addition to the Peal Products line of environmentally friendly sanitation and cleaning products (which were soon given outstanding performance ratings by Powerboat Reports and Practical Sailor), Peal Products was a distributor for every major US manufacturer of marine toilets, MSDs, and related equipment and accessories. As a member of ABYC, she was a member of a sanitation project technical committee formed to establish a standard for sanitation equipment and installation onboard from its inception in 1991 through 1996. In 1999 Mrs. Hall sold the Peal Products product line to Raritan Engineering, a major manufacturer of sanitation equipment. She is now an independent consultant.</p><h2>Just Jesus: His Living Words</h2><p>Just Jesus contains the words Jesus spoke as he began, executed, and fulfilled his ministry here among us.

Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Frank Charles Laubach was an Evangelical Christian missionary and mystic known as &#34;The Apostle to the Illiterates.&#34; One of his most widely influential devotional works was a pamphlet entitled &#34;The Game with Minutes.&#34; In it, Laubach urged Christians to attempt keeping God in mind for at least one second of every minute of the day. In this way Christians can attempt the attitude of constant prayer spoken of in the Epistle to the Colossians. The pamphlet extolled the virtues of a life lived with unceasing focus on God. Laubach&#39;s insight came from his experiments in prayer detailed in a collection of his letters published under the title, &#34;Letters by a Modern Mystic.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Surviving the Great Indoors: A Baby Blues Collection (Volume 36)</h2><p><b>The zaniest and most-relatable newspaper comic about parenting life is back with a brand-new collection.</b><br><br><i>Baby Blues</i> transcends the comic page by fusing the award-winning imaginations of Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott with familiar family life.&nbsp;Kirkman and Scott intuitively balance the humorous with the poignant through relatable and sometimes all-too-familiar parenting scenes.

Then the influence of a new mentor (I will someday write about, in a forthcoming memoir), I was compelled, provoked, stimulated to share new insights and perspectives with my readers.&nbsp; So, what began as a small booklet I was going to call "awakening the three selves" transformed, as if on its own accord, into <i>Sacred Journey of the Peaceful Warrior</i>. <br><br>The odd thing about this story is that it is <i>not</i> a sequel -- that is, it doesn't pick up at the end of my first book.&nbsp; Rather, this story takes place <i>within</i> the time-frame of my first book, <i>Way of the Peaceful Warrior</i>, during a period of travel and exploration after Socrates sent me away to find myself and my place in the world.&nbsp; So literally, one can read my first book to about page 184, then read <i>Sacred Journey</i>, and then complete the first book to get a proper sense of chronology.&nbsp; I don't necessarily suggest that readers do this, but only want to place this story in its proper time and context.<br><br>As I write this note (in March of 2011), I am preparing to write the third book in the series, that does in fact follow, chronologically, from the end of <i>Sacred Journey</i>.&nbsp; More on that later...<br><br>In the meantime, I hope readers enjoy reading of my adventures with the woman I called Mama Chia, a Hawai'ian kahuna, a healer and sage, as I learn some fundamental secrets about who we are and where we're going.</p><h2>Understanding the Twelve Steps: An Interpretation and Guide for Recovering</h2><p>Millions of people have transformed their lives by working the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. Their success has come from their ability to truly understand these principles and to apply them in their daily lives. Yet for many embarking on the road to recovery, the Steps can seem vague, even confusing.<br> This practical, no-nonsense guide takes the mystery out of the Twelve Steps, presenting a straightforward explanation of what each step means, as well as examples of how it translates to real life. Written by a certified alcoholism and drug abuse counselor with more than twenty years of experience, it offers a wealth of wisdom, knowledge, and genuine support for anyone in recovery.<br> <i>Understanding the Twelve Steps features:</i><br> &#x2014;Clear, easy-to-understand interpretation of the Twelve Steps&#x2014;the vital building blocks of recovery<br> &#x2014;Checklists that summarize the tasks and objectives of each step<br> &#x2014;The Twelve Promises -- the positive changes you can expect in your life if you follow the Twelve Steps<br> &#x2014;What happens at Twelve Step meetings and why it is important to have a sponsor<br> &#x2014;The experiences, strength, and hope of other recovering people</p><p><b>Terence T. Gorski, MA, N.C.A.C. II,</b>&nbsp;is the president of CENAPS� Corporation, a consultation and training firm that specializes in alcoholism, drug dependence, and mental-health services. He lives in Flossmoor, Illinois.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>WHAT IS A TWELVE STEP PROGRAM?</b><br><br>This book describes the single, most effective program for the treatment of alcoholism. That program, of course, is Alcoholics Anonymous, best known as A.A. Alcoholics Anonymous is a worldwide fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other in an effort to recover from alcoholism. It is a voluntary fellowship. No one is forced to belong, but millions of voluntary members benefit greatly from their involvement. If you want to make Twelve Step programs work for you, you need to understand the fellowship of A.A. and how to work with it. This book is intended to help you do just that.<br><br>Many people find the miracle of sobriety by working the Twelve Steps. Since nothing else has worked for them, many believe that the Steps are mystical and magical, and, as a result, these same persons fail to search for and identify the underlying principles that make them work. Working the Steps can create the miracle of sobriety, but the miracle isn't magic. The miracle occurs because working the Twelve Steps allows people to use powerful principles of recovery. Those who are willing to dig beneath the surface and truly understand the principles upon which the Steps are based are better able to use the principles in their lives.<br><br>The primary purpose of A.A. is to help alcoholics stop drinking. It was never intended to be all things to all people; however, A.A. recognizes that the Twelve Steps can help people with other problems. Thus, it allows organizations such as Narcotics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous, Marijuana Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, and others to use its Steps and principles. These related fellowships are developing as separate organizations so that A.A. can keep its primary focus on helping alcoholics to stop drinking.<br><br>A.A. is based upon a program of Twelve Steps to recovery that act as a personal guide to sobriety, and Twelve Traditions that act as guiding principles or bylaws for A.A. as a whole. Knowledge of the Twelve Steps is of critical importance to all recovering people for two reasons: (1) The Steps work if you work them, and (2) Twelve Step programs are inexpensive and readily available in most communities. As a result, they are the most widely used lifeline for people recovering from chemical dependence, codependence, and other compulsive or addictive disorders.<br><br><b>A.A. AS A NONPROFESSIONAL GROUP</b><br><br>As a result of the Traditions, A.A. is and shall forever remain nonprofessional. There are no medical professionals, as such, involved in designing or running A.A. or other Twelve Step programs. Although medical professionals do join as members, they have no more or no less influence on the organization than other members. Twelve Step programs do not provide medical or psychiatric treatment or psychotherapy. If you are involved in any Twelve Step program that has a psychotherapist in charge who runs it like a therapy group, be cautious. You are probably not at a Twelve Step meeting. This situation rarely, if ever, occurs in A.A.; however, it does happen in some of the newer Twelve Step programs.<br><br>If you are attending a Twelve Step meeting that is run by a psychotherapist who individually counsels the members, it is not a Twelve Step meeting; it is a therapy group. It is important to learn the difference, because Twelve Step meetings are based on the Twelve Steps of A.A. and the leaders act in a nonprofessional role.<br><br>A.A. members help themselves and others to stay sober. Members can be assured that they are not going to be solicited for donations or asked to get involved in anything else. Individual members of A.A. do have the right to participate in any religion, political forum, or cause that they wish. There are no restrictions. But they are not allowed to present themselves as A.A. members or to bring the name of A.A. into any controversy.<br><br><b>LEVELS OF TWELVE STEP INVOLVEMENT</b><br><br>Nobody is forced to do anything in A.A. It is one of the few organizations I know that supports the inherent constitutional right to do what we want. There is no coercion to participate on any level. If you want to belong, that's fine. You are welcome to attend meetings and work the Steps. If you don't want to belong, that's also fine.<br><br>For most members, however, their involvement progresses through a number of levels. At the first level, they attend meetings. At the second, they read Twelve Step literature and discuss it with other members of the program. At the third level, they get a sponsor who can show them how the program works. At the fourth level, they start working the Twelve Steps. As members start to grow and change -- a result of attending meetings and working the Steps -- they are ready to move to a fifth level of involvement and begin sponsoring others. After they gain experience as sponsors, they are then ready for the sixth level of involvement, general service work, guided by A.A.'s Twelve Traditions, the set of principles that act as bylaws. General service work is designed to benefit A.A. as a whole. Notice the progression: Individuals help themselves first, then they help other people in the program, then they help the program as a whole. In summary, the levels of involvement are as follows:<br><br>1. Attending meetings<br><br>2. Reading and discussing A.A. literature<br><br>3. Getting a sponsor<br><br>4. Working the Twelve Steps<br><br>5. Sponsoring others<br><br>6. Service guided by the Traditions<br><br><b>Attending Meetings</b><br><br>You start working a Twelve Step program by regularly attending meetings. In A.A. it is said, "If you bring the body, the mind will follow," because the Twelve Step program rubs off on people if they hang around long enough. Attending meetings isn't a passive process. Working a program means you need to get actively involved, participating at the meetings you attend. The easiest way to take part is to say, "I pass" -- a perfectly acceptable remark. No one in a Twelve Step program is obligated to say more. Most people, however, want to say more because they find it both enjoyable and beneficial. The more open and honest your comments, the faster you get well.<br><br>There is a joke that asks, "What is the difference between a drunk and an alcoholic?" Answer: "A drunk doesn't have to go to meetings; an alcoholic does!" A.A. stresses the importance of attending meetings, especially during the first three months of sobriety. Many members suggest attending ninety meetings in ninety days. By doing "ninety in ninety," beginners receive an intense exposure to the Twelve Step program and the people who use it. The principle that underlies doing "ninety in ninety" is a simple one -- the more meetings you attend early on, the greater your chances of long-term recovery. There is no rule, of course, that you have to attend exactly ninety meetings in the first ninety days; go as often as your lifestyle allows. But keep in mind that the more meetings you attend, the faster you will get well.<br><br>Many members complain about having to attend meetings, but those who recover keep going even when they don't feel like it. You don't have to like going to meetings, you just have to keep going. Meetings are the lifeline to sobriety. When you attend meetings, you take a needed time-out from an alcohol- and drug-centered world and remind yourself that you are an alcoholic, cannot safely use alcohol and other drugs, and that you need the fellowship of other sober alcoholics to stay sober.<br><br><b>Reading Twelve Step Literature</b><br><br>The second level of involvement is to read Twelve Step literature and discuss your reactions, both positive and negative, with other members. The early members of A.A. identified the basic principles needed to get sober and stay that way. They compiled that information in two books -- <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> (often called the Big Book) and <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.</i> Both books are available from the central office of Alcoholics Anonymous in New York City. These books provide the basic principles needed to begin living the sober life.<br><br><b>Getting a Sponsor</b><br><br>After you feel comfortable going to meetings, making comments, and reading the basic literature, the third level of involvement is to get a sponsor. A sponsor is another member of the Twelve Step program who has more experience at recovery than you do. In order to get a sponsor, you must have participated in the program long enough to get to know people. Listen to the comments of others. Try to find someone you respect and admire, someone who knows more than you do about the program and can show you the ropes. In the business world, a sponsor is called a mentor.<br><br>When you find such a person and ask him or her to be your sponsor, you are in essence asking, "Would you be willing to spend time with me and teach me how you work the program?" There's a slogan in the Twelve Step program: "If you want what we have, you do what we did." And it's primarily in the sponsorship relationship that this principle comes alive. You find a sponsor who has the type of recovery you would like to have, ask him to teach you what steps he took, and then try to do those things in your recovery.<br><br>A therapist does not take the place of a sponsor. You need a Twelve Step sponsor even if you have the best therapist in the world. A good therapist will encourage recovering people to become involved in Twelve Step programs and to get a sponsor. As a therapist, I don't mandate Twelve Step attendance, but I do strongly encourage it. If someone refuses to attend even one meeting to see what the organization is all about, I may say, "If you're not willing to go to Twelve Step meetings, I'm not willing to treat you. Why? Because if you're not willing to go and find out what Twelve Step programs involve, I don't think you really want to do what's necessary to recover." I base this attitude on an A.A. slogan: "We must be willing to go to any lengths to get sober." If you are not willing to clear a few evenings and attend some meetings, I question your willingness to do what is necessary to recover.<br><br><b>Work the Steps</b><br><br>Once you have a solid relationship with a good sponsor, you move to the fourth level: working the Twelve Steps. Step work under the guidance of a sponsor is literally the heart and soul of most Twelve Step programs, and the bulk of this book deals with how to work the Steps. Members who go to meetings but refuse to work the Steps are not really working the program. To quote the Big Book, "Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path." People who genuinely want to recover do more than just go to meetings: They work the Steps under the guidance of their sponsor. Those who are not serious about recovery don't work the steps. It's just that simple.<br><br><b>Sponsoring Others</b><br><br>By attending meetings, reading Twelve Step literature, talking frequently with sponsors, and working the Steps, you begin to grow and change. The program will start to transform you. As you learn and grow, you need to reach out and start giving back to others what has been given to you so freely. In short, it is time to move onto the fifth level and begin sponsoring others.<br><br>Sponsorship has two purposes: to help yourself and to help the person you sponsor. It is important to remember that you sponsor others in order to help yourself. You are in no way responsible for the recovery or relapse of the people you sponsor. The primary goal is to share freely your own experience, strength, and hope, and by doing so, you help yourself and may help the person you are sponsoring. But there are no guarantees. A.A. is a selfish program: Recovering people help others in order to help themselves. This attitude is clearly summed up in an A.A. slogan: "In order to keep it, you have to give it away."<br><br>By pairing with someone who is less experienced with the Twelve Steps than you are, and by trying to help him or her, you gain new insights into your own recovery. When I first started teaching courses on counseling, I realized how much I didn't know. I became motivated to learn more. The same is true in sponsorship. When you try to answer the questions of a newcomer, you become aware of your own ignorance. You gain the courage to stretch and to grow. When someone you are sponsoring asks you a question and you don't know the answer, it is time to go to your own sponsor. By helping others, we have been forced to learn. The formula is simple: Attend meetings, work the Steps, have a sponsor, and sponsor others.<br><br><b>Service Guided by the Traditions</b><br><br>The sixth level of involvement is service guided by the Traditions. Every organization needs bylaws, and Twelve Step programs are no exception. The twelve fundamental bylaws that govern the operation of Twelve Step programs are called the Traditions. There is a need to maintain the organization of a Twelve Step program in order to make sure that the program continues to be available to help others. It is important to keep first things first. Service work is secondary to working the Steps and learning how to stay comfortable in recovery. But once A.A. members have a firm handle on their own recovery, service work is important to ensure the survival of the organization as a whole.<br><br><b>IN ORDER TO KEEP IT, YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT AWAY</b><br><br>Father Joseph Martin, the creator of the film <i>Chalk Talk</i> and cofounder of the Ashley treatment center in Havre de Grace, Maryland, told me this story of A.A.'s cofounder, Bill Wilson. Bill tried to stay sober all by himself for a long period of time, but he could never manage more than a few weeks of sobriety. Then he had this crazy notion that maybe he could help himself stay sober by helping other people to stay sober. The first approach Bill tried was what I call the "scrape them off the bar stool" approach. He talked to all of his friends with drinking problems and tried to convince them to stop. Basically, he went on a crusade to sober up drunks. Six months later, he told his wife, Lois, "I've failed. I've been trying to help alcoholics now for six months, and I haven't helped one person to get sober." Lois looked at him and said, "Bill, you're wrong. You have helped someone. <i>You</i> haven't had a drink in six months." Thus, one of the first principles of A.A. was born. It is summarized in the slogan, "In order to keep it, you have to give it away." The benefit of A.A. is that its members, recovering people in Twelve Step programs, get well by helping others to get well.<br><br>By trying to help others, people in recovery transcend their own selfishness; they interrupt the self-centeredness that is central to most addictions and compulsions. By trying to help others, addicts no longer remain the central part of their own personal addictive network. They begin to expand their world beyond the tip of their nose. In doing so, they find new values to govern their lives.<br><br>A.A. provides a number of crystal-clear guidelines: Don't drink, go to meetings, get a sponsor, work the Steps. Beyond these basics, there is a lot of ambiguity. After reading A.A. literature or attending a meeting, it is common for a member to scratch his or her head and ask, "What does that mean?" Part of the power of A.A. lies in this ambiguity, which forces people to provide their own meaning when working the program. Recovering people must make up their own minds and decide what the A.A. principles mean for them. One of the hallmarks of A.A. is that it's a "selfish" program. Members decide for themselves what they take out of the meetings. Nobody tells them what their experience is. They take what fits them and they leave the rest.<br><br><b>THE TRADITIONS</b><br><br>Knowledge of the Traditions is...</p><h2>Mid-Century Modern Living: The Mini Modern&#39;s guide to pattern and style</h2><p><b>In this beautifully photographed book, Keith and Mark of Mini Moderns show you how to create a timeless mid-century look in your own home.</b><br><br>Keith and Mark of Mini Moderns refer to their design ethos as 'pattern with a story'.

Students are taught using the "mother-tongue" approach. Each series of books for a particular instrument in the Suzuki Method is considered a Suzuki music school, such as the Suzuki Cello School. Suzuki lessons are generally given in a private studio setting with additional group lessons. The student listens to the recordings and works with their Suzuki cello teacher to develop their potential as a musician and as a person. <br><br>This Suzuki piano accompaniment book aids in Suzuki cello lessons. <br><br>Titles: Long, Long Ago (Bayly) * May Time, Komm Lieber Mai (Longing for Spring) from Sehnsucht nach dem Fr�hlinge, K. 96 (Mozart) * Minuet No. 1, Minuett III from Suite in G Minor for Klavier, BWV 822 (Bach) * Minuet No. 3, Minuet in C, BWV Anh.

E. Cummings poem, beautifully illustrated by Mati Rose McDonough. Showing the strong bond of love between mother and child, within nature and throughout life, Cummings&#x2019; heartfelt words expressed through McDonough&#x2019;s lovely illustrations combine to create a fresh, yet classic, portrayal of love.</p><p>E. E. Cummings (1894&#x2013;1962) was among the most influential, widely read, and revered modernist poets. His many awards included an Academy of American Poets Fellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, and the Bollingen Prize. Among his many volumes are The Enormous Room and Tulips &amp; Chimneys.<br><br>Mati Rose McDonough lives in San Francisco where she regularly encounters lucky elephants, talking birds, and a mysterious girl who always wears feathers in her hair. McDonough studied painting at the California College of the Arts and has had many shows around the country. She has been featured in several magazines and books including Artful Blogging magazine and The Handmade Marketplace.In her first children's book, artist McDonough imagines the mother-child relationship as the centerpiece for the e.e. cummings love poem "[i carry your heart with me(i carry it in]," written using its original format and punctuation. In serene mixed-media collages, a mother with soulful eyes, rosy cheeks, and her hair in a short, black bob accompanies her daughter through the early stages of her young life, from infancy to her daughter's first excursion into the world on her own. Tucked within a cozy nest or seen flying overhead, a cut-paper mother bird and its offspring mimic the mother and child during their bonding moments, as do two whimsical paper elephants, scrawled in cursive ink and newsprint. Decorative hearts, leaves, water motifs, and assorted fabrics are also integrated throughout, complementing rather than overwhelming McDonough's rich, solid colors. The message of growth, nurturing, and boundless love will reach readers, while Cummings's emotional and succinct verse stands autonomously: "and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant/ and whatever a sun will always sing is you." Ages 2 6. (Apr.) - <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>A mother shows her daughter the world, from season to season, from night into day, in the sweet, collage artwork that accompanies the poem [i carry your heart with me(i carry it in]&#x201d; by E.

This book demonstrates how the modern trend to promote self- esteem training, positive thinking, and the tenets of the self-help movement encourages self-obsession, which backfires and makes it harder for people to create success. Authors Andersen and Fritz make the ultimate case that what you think about yourself doesn t matter, nor does it determine your prospects of accomplishment. In fact, the more you focus on yourself, the less you are able to learn, grow, develop needed skills, and create what matters most to you. This book will ruffle many feathers in the self-help world by revealing how some of the most common concepts are simply not true and even harmful. On the other side of these concepts is freedom from illusions, dogma, and belief. The ideas in Identity will give you the opportunity to truly become the dominant force and author of your life building process.</p><p>Robert Jordan Fritz (born 1943 in Cambridge, Massachusetts) is an author, composer, filmmaker, and management consultant.

Their advice and examples will appeal to a wide target audience of parents, ranging from those with young children to college-age youth.

Their plantations were among the oldest and longest-standing plantations in the South. Between 1698 and 1865, close to four thousand black people were born into slavery under the Balls or were bought by them. In <i>Slaves in the Family, </i>Edward Ball recounts his efforts to track down and meet the descendants of his family's slaves. Part historical narrative, part oral history, part personal story of investigation and catharsis, <i>Slaves in the Family</i> is, in the words of Pat Conroy, "a work of breathtaking generosity and courage, a magnificent study of the complexity and strangeness and beauty of the word &#x2018;family.'"</p></p><p>Writer Edward Ball opens <i>Slaves in the Family</i> with an anecdote: "My father had a little joke that made light of our legacy as a family that had once owned slaves. 'There are five things we don't talk about in the Ball family,' he would say. 'Religion, sex, death, money and the Negroes.'" Ball himself seemed happy enough to avoid these touchy issues until an invitation to a family reunion in South Carolina piqued his interest in his family's extensive plantation and slave-holding past. He realized that he had a very clear idea of who his white ancestors were--their names, who their children and children's children were, even portraits and photographs--but he had only a murky vision of the black people who supported their livelihood and were such an intimate part of their daily lives; he knew neither their names nor what happened to them and their descendents after they were freed following the Civil War. So he embarked on a journey to uncover the history of the Balls and the black families with whom their lives were inextricably intertwined, as well as the less tangible resonance of slavery in both sets of families. From plantation records, interviews with descendents of both the Balls and their slaves, and travels to Africa and the American South, Ball has constructed a story of the riches and squalor, violence and insurrection--the pride and shame--that make up the history and legacy of slavery in America."EVERYONE SHOULD READ AND LEARN FROM THIS LUMINOUS BOOK...Like Alex Haley's Roots, through which African American history came into national focus...Slaves in the Family has the potential for creating a perceptual shift in the American mind...The book is not only honest in its scrupulous reporting but also personal narrative at its finest."<p>--<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>"BALL IS A FIRST-RATE SCHOLAR-JOURNALIST...He's also a good detective, tracking down the many descendants of Ball slaves from New York to California and back in the South and coaxing them, often with some difficulty, to tell their stories...Outside Faulkner, it will be hard to find a more poignant, powerful account of a white man struggling with his and his nation's past."</p><p>--<i>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i></p><p>"A MASTERPIECE...REMARKABLE...It is a work about slaves in the family. But it is also a large omnium gatherum of enchanting fireside anecdotes, secrets teased out of reluctant fragments from the remote past, the real lives of blacks and whites whose stories had been lost in the disintegrating churn of time until Edward Ball's patient reconstructions."</p><p>--<i>The Raleigh News &amp; Observer</i></p><p>"A TOUR DE FORCE...The heart of this remarkable book consists of his sleuthing<br>--tracking down and interviewing the descendants of former Ball slaves across the country...Part oral history, this unique family saga is a catharsis and a searching inventory of racially divided American society."</p><p>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred and boxed review)</p><p>"FASCINATING READING; <br>THERE IS SIMPLY NOTHING QUITE LIKE IT IN PRINT."</p><p>--<i>The Boston Sunday Globe</i></p><p>"There is much to admire in Ball's very willingness to challenge the generations of silence in his white family and to search out black kin whose reactions he had every reason to fear. And there is much to learn as well from a book that reminds us that slavery possesses not just a national and cultural significance but, for many Americans, a very direct and personal immediacy, even in the late 20th century. In naming the names...Ball contributes to at least partly reclaiming the humanity slavery worked to obliterate. He reminds us that slavery was not just about economics or politics or even abstract questions of morality, but most essentially about the millions of human being imprisoned within its chains."</p><p>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"Not since Alex Haley's Roots has there been such a pure act of recovery of the African American experience...It is a work of breathtaking generosity and courage, a magnificent study of the complexity and strangeness and beauty of the word 'family.' "</p><p>--PAT CONROY</p><p>"If Cold Mountain was closer to a nature study than a Civil War story, this book is the real thing: a narrative with runaway slaves, night patrols, plantation lords, wastrel heirs, and a loony widow...A fascinating domestic history."</p><p>--<i>The Cleveland Plain Dealer</i></p><p>"Not since William Faulkner wrote his masterpiece Absalom, Absalom! in 1936 has any writer rendered a more hauntingly poignant exploration of the dark roots and bitter fruits of slavery in America."</p><p>--<i>The Baltimore Sun</i></p><p>"This book, a brilliant blend of archival research and oral history, tells what [Ball] found<br>--a painful past relieved by the presence of vivid individuals."</p><p>--<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>"MOVING AND DISARMINGLY FRANK."</p><p>--<i>The Christian Science Monitor</i></p><p>"Powerful...Edward Ball is a writer who possesses both skill and bravery...A book that is an amazing amalgamation of history, detective work, sociology and personal catharsis. It covers not only the days of slavery, but investigates the intertwined lives of blacks and whites into the 20th century. Ball's history is impeccable...Slaves in the Family deserves wide readership. It is a fine portrait of how the legacy of an evil institution still resonates in the collective memories of black and white Americans."</p><p>--<i>The Chattanooga Times</i></p><p>"Fascinating...Ball is an accomplished portrait artist, delivering characters in quick, pointed strokes. His ear is perfect also, able to discern a Southern accent that is more cotton than rice. Most importantly, Slaves in the Family accomplishes something that the currently fashionable but little-yielding 'dialogues' on race cannot seem to; it underscores the complexity of blood and manners as an aspect of race in this country."</p><p>--<i>New York Post</i></p><p>"An expos� of the original black/white divide in this country, as embodied in one extended family and the people they owned...By daring to zero in on his own family's trade, Ball breaks hundreds of years of silence from white people<br>--the only way to begin this dialogue between black and white people."</p><p>--<i>The Village Voice</i></p><p>"A fascinating and important work that should be read by as many Americans as possible."</p><p>--<i>The Washington Times</i></p><p>"[An] unblinking history not only of his ancestors but also of the people they held as slaves...It reminds us of our common humanity and of the ties that still bind us, no matter what the wounds of the past."</p><p>--<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i></p><p>"SENSITIVE AND FORMIDABLE...THE HISTORICAL SECTIONS UTTERLY RIVET."</p><p>--<i>Newsday</i></p><p>"This is a powerful personal memoir of a spiritual as much as an anthropological journey into history. One of Ball's white relatives feared that the author's probing into taboo matters would 'dig up my grandfather and hang him.' The larger meaning of the book lies not in condemnation or retribution so much as in the ways Ball recovers and respects a buried past. A stunning, dangerous book for each generation to ponder; highly recommended."</p><p>--<i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)</p><p>"Ball's impressive detective work and the black voices it records build a monumental and extraordinary case history of the rise and fall of America's most shameful institution. Together, their searing, soul-searching grappling with past sins strikes deep at the heart of the country's enduring racial division."</p><p>--<i>Kirkus Reviews </i>(starred review)</p><p>"An informative, ruminative, and inspirational page-turner."</p><p>--<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</p><p>"[Slaves in the Family is] much more than bare history...It's the human encounters, and the live, breathing juxtaposition of past and present, that give [Ball's] book its vibrancy and importance."</p><p>--<i>Detroit Free Press</i></p><p>"Remarkable, candid...Utterly compelling...A powerfully valuable testament."</p><p>--<i>The State</i> (Columbia, SC)</p><p>"Illuminating."</p><p>--<i>New York Daily News</i></p><p>"Part historical narrative and part personal odyssey, this extraordinarily accessible and creative narrative should be read by anyone with an interest in African-American or southern history."</p><p>--<i>The Post and Courier</i></p><p>"A remarkable look at how slavery lives on in our nation's memory and experience, and, perhaps, an important step toward racial harmony."</p><p>--<i>In Review</i> (Nashville)</p><p>"A pageantry of passions and struggles, Slaves in the Family is an unprecedented chronicle that is part history, and part the author's incredible journey towards the revelation and reconstruction of the genealogies of the slaves in his family's plantation. And ultimately the startling discovery of the slaves in 'his' family."</p><p>--<i>African Sun Times</i></p></p><h2>ThetaHealing�: Digging for Beliefs: How to Rewire Your Subconscious Thinking for Deep Inner Healing</h2><p><b>New ThetaHealing� handbook for fans of the ThetaHealing� teachings by best-selling author Vianna Stibal, exploring step-by-step how to Dig for bottom beliefs and rewire your subconscious thinking for deep and transformative healing.</b><br><br>In this companion book to T<i>hetaHealing�, Advanced ThetaHealing�, ThetaHealing Diseases and Disorders�, </i>and<i> The Planes of Existence�</i>, bestselling author Vianna Stibal shares an in-depth process to Digging for Beliefs, an integral part of the ThetaHealing� modality.<br><br>ThetaHealing� is a revolutionary technique developed by Stibal that allows a person to enter into a state of deep meditation, tap into the brain's Theta waves, and activate incredible healing powers.

This series separates these lessons into common themes in eight instructive books that can be used in any order. Books are colorful and non-consumable, with an accompanying workbook to record the student s work. Children will improve their drawing skills, refine their handwriting clarity, and enjoy learning in the process!</p><p>Learn about the speedy jackrabbit, climb peaks with mountain goats, and plunge into the oceans&#x2019; dark depths with the angler fish! Get an overview of the variety of animal habitats on earth &#x2013; land, freshwater, and saltwater &#x2013; while drawing and writing about them. The series won the Teachers' Choice Award, is a regular recipient of Practical Homeschooling Reader Awards, and was selected one of the top new products at NSSEA Ed Expo 2001.Drawing instruction gave me a means to encourage my students to be observant. For instance, after drawing a jackrabbit together and thinking of backgrounds for drawings, the children and I went to the window and looked at the bluish-purple mountain range on the horizon, or the wispy clouds in the sky. Most children need guidance like this to build strong observational skill. I know my students&#39; ability to notice details also strengthened through drawing. While drawing, you have to focus on things like the diagonal patterns on a pinecone, or the graceful droop of a vine with heart-shaped leaves. My students&#39; ability to listen and follow directions was good, because they had to listen carefully as we went through the process of drawing the subject. With paper, pencil and crayons, I was able to watch the children blossom as they developed their visual skills and gained the self-discipline to listen well. The more drawings we made together, the easier it became for! the children to read, learn math concepts, and write, so I gradually developed enough lessons to give one each morning of the school year. I don&#39;t know what I would have done without drawing instruction in my classroom! -- Marie Hablitzel</p><h2>A Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison</h2><p>Mary Jemison (1743&#x2013;1833) was an American frontierswoman and an adopted Seneca. When she was in her teens, she was captured in what is now Adams County, Pennsylvania, from her home along Marsh Creek, and later chose to remain a Seneca. This fascinating book tells her story.</p><p>In 1758, fifteen-year-old Mary Jemison and her family were captured near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by a Shawnee and French raiding party. Shortly thereafter, her family was killed; she was turned over to a Seneca family, adopted by them, and four years later taken to their western New York homeland--where, by choice, she spent the rest of her life as an Iroquois wife, mother, and landed proprietor.James E. Seaver, a 19th-century author, is best known for writing &#34;A Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison&#34;.</p><h2>Roberts and Hedges&#x2019; Clinical Procedures in Emergency Medicine and Acute Care</h2><p><p>Comprehensive, detailed, and up to date, <i>Roberts and &amp; Hedges' Clinical Procedures in Emergency Medicine and Acute Care, 7th Edition</i>, provides <b>highly visual coverage of both common and uncommon procedures encountered in emergency medicine and acute care practice</b>.

Practically overnight the stock market has plummeted, hyperinflation has crippled commerce, and the fragile chains of supply and high-technology infrastructure have fallen. The power grids are down. Brutal rioting and looting grip every major city. The volatile era known as &#x201c;the Crunch&#x201d; has begun, and this new period in our history will leave no one untouched. In this unfamiliar environment, only a handful of individuals are equipped to survive. The world of Survivors is a terrifyingly familiar one. Rawles has written a novel so close to the truth, readers will forget it&#x2019;s fiction. If everything you thought you knew suddenly fell apart, would you survive?</p><p>Former US Army intelligence officer and survivalist James Wesley Rawles is a well-known survival lecturer and author. Rawles is the editor of SurvivalBlog.com&#x2014;the nation&#x2019;s most popular blogs on family preparedness. He lives in an undisclosed location west of the Rockies.

An unarmed man can only flee from evil, and evil is not overcome by fleeing from it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x2014;Col. Jeff Cooper<br> <br> FOB Wolverine, Task Force Duke, Zabul Province, Afghanistan<br>October, the First Year <br> <br>Andy was awoken by the sound of mortars. His many months in Afghanistan had taught him the difference in sound between outgoing and incoming mortars and various artillery. These were distant mortars, so he knew that it wasn&#x2019;t friendly fire. Andy already had Operation Enduring Freedom camouflage pattern (OCP) pants and interceptor body armor (IBA) on, and was snatching up his M4 carbine and helmet when the take-shelter warning siren sounded. He popped out the door of his containerized housing unit (CHU) and jumped down into the entrance of the heavily sandbagged shelter, just a few steps away. Moments later the two lieutenants from the CHU next door piled in behind him. One of them took the precaution of scanning with a flashlight the floor and walls of the shelter for scorpions. He found just one and stomped it without comment.<br> <br>The mortar rounds started to come in, with a succession of sharp blasts that shook the ground. There were about twenty impacts, arriving in a span of ten seconds. They could see the flashes of the explosions reflected on the wall opposite the doorway. The closest round impacted about one hundred feet away&#x2014;close enough that shock waves could be felt.<br> <br>As the rounds came in, Andy Laine said a silent prayer. He knew that only a direct hit would endanger him, but it was still unnerving, since he had less than a month left in-country.<br> <br>&#x201c;That may be all she wrote, sir,&#x201d; said one of the lieutenants dryly.<br> <br>Laine agreed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re probably right. Just another shoot-&#x2019;n&#x2019;-scoot deal.&#x201d;<br> <br>At the far side of the forward operating base (FOB), they could hear the echoed commands from the Arty boys, and then the deep-throated crumps of outgoing mortars. They sounded like big 4.2-inch mortars, just three rounds. Andy marveled at how quickly the counter-battery radar team could pinpoint the insurgents&#x2019; firing location and direct return fire. Less than a minute after the enemy rounds impacted, the reply was sent, no doubt with considerable precision. It was no wonder that the mortar duels with the <i>jihadis</i> had become less frequent in recent months.<br> <br>As they waited for the all-clear horn, Andy leaned against the sandbag wall and stretched his calf muscles, more out of habit than because of any stiffness. At six feet two inches, with a runner&#x2019;s physique, he weighed just 180 pounds, and prided himself on his flexibility. When doing physical training (PT) with his units in garrison, he was always among the most limber.<br> <br>The next morning, along with dozens of his fellow Fobbits, Laine did a bit of gawking at the damage done by the mortars. It actually wasn&#x2019;t much. One round had shredded the corner of a CHU and another perforated a tent with dozens of small holes&#x2014;the largest about three inches across. All the rest of the mortar impacts had no effect, leaving only black marks on the ground and some scattered shrapnel. A couple of the newbies to the FOB posed for pictures in front of the damaged CHU. &#x201c;So what? Big deal,&#x201d; Andy muttered to himself as he walked to the company headquarters.<br> <br>At thirty-one years old, Andrew Laine was the typical lean and fit U.S. Army captain. He was on his second deployment to Afghanistan. His first had been to Iraq. On this new deployment, his assignment was &#x201c;branch immaterial.&#x201d; Although he was branched Ordnance Corps, he was assigned as a staff officer in a Stryker battalion, an infantry unit equipped with sixteen-ton wheeled armored personnel carriers (APCs). With the heavy manpower requirements of ongoing deployments to Afghanistan, it was not unusual for officers to get assignments outside of their usual career path. &#x201c;The needs of the Army&#x201d; was the reason often cited when making these assignments.<br> <br>Andy and his older brother Lars had grown up in the shadow of their late father, Robie Laine, a Finnish-born Army officer who retired as a full colonel. Their father earned his U.S. citizenship by joining the U.S. Army, and eventually retired to a small horse ranch near Bloomfield, New Mexico. Robie had been raised on a farm and was convinced that he should retire on a farm. Their late mother was an American of mostly Swedish ancestry. She had died of breast cancer when the boys were in high school.<br> <br>Following the mortar barrage, Andy spent a frustrating ten-hour day of pushing paper for the battalion, which was greatly complicated by the process of the unit&#x2019;s upcoming redeployment to Germany. That afternoon, Andy chatted with Larry Echanis, the battalion S-1, the staff officer in charge of personnel. Echanis had been Laine&#x2019;s martial arts sparring partner for the past several months. He had taught Andy some Hwa Rang Do <i>kata</i>s, and Andy reciprocated, teaching Larry his mixed martial arts moves.<br> <br>Their battalion (or &#x201c;squadron,&#x201d; in Stryker parlance) was a forward deployed part of the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment, headquartered in Vilseck, Germany. The incoming squadron was a sister unit in the same regiment, and also part of Task Force Duke. But Andy&#x2019;s squadron was headed back to Germany, in a regularly scheduled unit rotation.<br> <br>Laine and Echanis had been discussing events back home. Lately, the war effort had been taking a backseat to tumultuous economic events emanating from New York City and the world&#x2019;s other financial centers. Larry Echanis seemed worried but was trying to be upbeat. He asked, &#x201c;You think that this&#x2019;ll blow over, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>Laine put on a glum face. &#x201c;At this point, there&#x2019;s no way. The whole system is breaking down. The global credit market is frozen, the sovereign debt problems have blown up past the GDP levels for most countries, and the derivatives have totally imploded. We&#x2019;re in a world of hurt. I think there&#x2019;ll be some major riots and looting soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>Echanis bit his lip. &#x201c;Well, that won&#x2019;t be a big deal for my family. Most of them live in eastern Oregon. Have you ever been through Ontario, Oregon? It&#x2019;s out in the middle of nowhere. The disruption will be in the big cities. Our town is three hundred miles from Portland, and more than three hundred and fifty from Seattle as the crow flies.&#x201d;<br> <br>Laine shook his head. &#x201c;I wish it was that simple. Sure, the riots will be in the big cities. The metro areas will be death traps. The suburbs will be only marginally safer. But you got to realize that these days even the small towns are dependent on long chains of supply. When the eighteen-wheelers stop rolling, <i>everyone</i> is gonna be hurting. It will definitely be safer out in the boonies. But you should tell your family to stock up on every scrap of food they can find. They need to get <i>out</i> of dollars and into canned goods right away.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You really think it&#x2019;ll get that bad?&#x201d;<br> <br>Laine answered soberly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it will. Does your family live in town or out on a ranch?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Used to be ranchers. All in town now, but we&#x2019;re Basques, so we still know how to live the old-fashioned way. My mom used to cook a lot of our meals in a dutch oven. I didn&#x2019;t even know how fast food tasted until I went off to college. There&#x2019;s no comparison to my mom&#x2019;s cooking.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, with those skills, and living where they do, they&#x2019;ll probably ride the storm out pretty safely.&#x201d;<br> <br>The conversation left Andy feeling uneasy about his plans for leaving active duty. Strapping on his MOLLE vest to leave his desk at the battalion headquarters, Andy turned to Echanis to say, &#x201c;Well, when the going gets tough, the tough go <i>shopping</i>. I&#x2019;m going to stop by my CHU and grab a duffel bag and then I&#x2019;m off to the Haji-mart.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was 90 degrees but felt even hotter, since Andy was wearing IBA and had the weight of an M4 carbine slung across his back, a PRC-148 radio, and numerous MOLLE magazine pouches. The only concession to being in a relatively safe area was that he was wearing a boonie hat instead of a MICH helmet.<br> <br>As Captain Laine walked past the guards manning the HESCO barriers at the FOB&#x2019;s main gate, he read the signs on the Haji market windows just across the road. They proclaimed: &#x201c;Very Best PriceS,&#x201d; &#x201c;DVD,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Custtom TailoreR.&#x201d; As he walked in the door, the smell of the market hit Andy like a hammer. It was an odd mix of Turkish tobacco smoke, incense, kerosene, sweat, and overcooked lamb. It certainly didn&#x2019;t smell like the exchange store back at the FOB. Aside from the hint of JP8 jet fuel, which was a presence everywhere in the FOB, the exchange smelled just like any retail store in America: hardly any smell at all&#x2014;almost antiseptic. In contrast, Ali&#x2019;s store reeked. An aging Italian-made air conditioner was roaring above the door but not keeping up. It was perhaps 10 degrees cooler inside than outside.<br> <br>Nabil Jassim Ali gave his usual &#x201c;Salaam, salaam, Mr. Colonel&#x201d; greeting. The portly and balding Pashtuni flashed his yellowed, crooked teeth. He called all the American soldiers &#x201c;Colonel,&#x201d; even the privates. It still made Andy laugh every time he heard it.<br> <br>Eyeing the empty duffel bag slung over Laine&#x2019;s shoulder, Ali chortled. &#x201c;Perhaps you are wanting to buy plentiful numbers of thingings, Mr. Colonel?&#x201d; Laine nodded. Ali waved him in and added, &#x201c;The store I am closing in a few minutes, but for you, Colonel, I am willing to be late.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You always have the best deals, Mr. Ali,&#x201d; Andy said with a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you have afghanis? The American dollar not so good, today. It is slipping off another five percent.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Down five percent in one week?&#x201d; Andy asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;In <i>one day,</i> Colonel,&#x201d; Ali replied seriously. &#x201c;Soon, I think, I take no more American money.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, sir. I have plenty of afghanis.&#x201d; His front pocket indeed bulged with a huge wad of cash: a mix of afghanis, dollars, and a few euros. In the bottom of his pocket he also felt the weight of eighteen American Eagle one-ounce silver coins in plastic sleeves.<br> <br>Ali&#x2019;s store had the usual &#x201c;Haji-mart&#x201d; merchandise. There were cigarettes, pirated CDs and DVDs, imitation designer sunglasses, magazines (mostly in Arabic), cheap Chinese knives and ersatz Leatherman tools, candy, sunflower seeds, sodas and sports drinks, jerky, chewing gum, and assorted trinkets.<br> <br>There were three young Stryker troops already in the store when Captain Laine arrived. When he passed them in the dimly lit narrow aisles, they each acknowledged him with a hushed &#x201c;High speed, sir!&#x201d; That was the newly arrived battalion&#x2019;s unofficial motto. But Andy was accustomed to hearing it at a much higher volume inside the FOB.<br> <br>Laine sorted through packets of jerky, settling mostly on the teriyaki flavor, piling up a large stack in the crook of his left arm. The three enlisted soldiers completed their purchases, buying the usual Fobbit food: energy bars, packets of salty chips, and Coca-Colas that came in cans with both English and Arabic markings.<br> <br>After the three soldiers left the store, Laine stacked the packets of jerky on the counter. Then he walked back to the shelf to get a second armload. This, too, he stacked on the counter. Ali smiled. &#x201c;Perhaps you are wanting to buy all of my jer-kee?&#x201d; he asked. Laine chuckled, and replied, &#x201c;Well, not all of it; just most of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Next he went to stock up on batteries. He ignored the Egyptian bargain brand&#x2014;of dubious quality&#x2014;and selected a dozen four-packs of Energizer AA batteries, being careful to pick the ones with the latest expiration dates. While Laine was sorting battery packages, Ali locked the front door and turned the &#x201c;OPEN&#x201d; sign around.<br> <br>Laine stacked the batteries in a couple of piles next to the jerky on the counter, then his gaze shifted to Ali&#x2019;s permanent smile. After a pause, Laine asked, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard that you sell some other, ah, unusual merchandise that you keep in back.&#x201d; He pointed to the doorway to the back room, which among other things served as a kitchen and bedroom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, I have none alcohol. It is forbidden.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no. That is not what I meant. I&#x2019;ve heard that you have some more expensive merchandise, like watches, some good optics, and guns.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali&#x2019;s smile got bigger than usual and he nodded. &#x201c;One moment, Mr. Colonel,&#x201d; he said, then disappeared into the back room.<br> <br>Ali returned lugging a large suitcase, and Laine knew that he&#x2019;d struck pay dirt. This was where the rumor mill at the FOB said the shopkeeper reputedly kept &#x201c;the good stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali gently slid the heavy suitcase onto the store counter, unfastened the latches, and spun it around. He opened it to display a large assortment of new and used wristwatches, digital cameras, film cameras, binoculars, assorted boxes of ammunition, and a few pistol holsters.<br> <br>Laine and Ali spent the next five minutes haggling over the price of a pair of rubber-armored Nikon 7x30 compact binoculars. They finally settled on a figure that seemed high to Andy, but he assented, realizing the prices would surely be double that in less than a month, perhaps in just a few days.<br> <br>Laine paid for the jerky, batteries, and binoculars, nearly depleting his wad of afghanis. Eyeing the boxes of ammo, he said: &#x201c;I see you have some nine-millimeter ammunition here. Do you have any pistols in that caliber?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali frowned. &#x201c;Yes, Colonel, I do, but you are cannot be afford them. Prices are&#x2014;what is it they say&#x2014;&#x2018;escalating.&#x2019; For a pistol, a good one, we are conversing of $5,000, American.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What if I paid you in silver, uhh, <i>lujain</i> coins? <i>Lujain</i>?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ahhh! <i>Lujain!</i> This works for me. In Kabul, silver closed today at eighty-three American dollars for one ounce. In London it was eighty-one dollars.&#x201d; Andy nodded. The man certainly knew his markets.<br> <br>Mr. Ali turned and again walked to the back room. Laine heard the sounds of boxes being shifted and restacked. Soon the store owner returned with another suitcase that looked even older than the first. He put it on the counter, flipped the latches, and swung it open. Captain Laine let out a slight gasp when he saw the contents. The suitcase was crammed full of pistols, revolvers, holsters, and magazines.<br> <br>Andy sorted through the guns. He saw older Afghan Army&#x2013;issue Tokarevs, a few ancient revolvers that looked either Belgian or German, and a couple of Egyptian Helwan pistols. One revolver immediately seemed suspect. It was a Pakistani copy of a Webley .38 revolver. Looking closely at the gun, he saw that it was peppered with fake proof mark stampings and was erroneously stamped &#x201c;WELBEY.&#x201d; That made Andy laugh.<br> <br>Seeing Andy&#x2019;s expression, the storekeeper noted: &#x201c;The guns from Peshawar, they are not so good.&#x201d;<br> <br>Andy replied, &#x201c;Now, that&#x2019;s an understatement!&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t trust their metallurgy and mechanical tolerances any more than he did their spelling.<br> <br>Putting the revolver down, Andy noticed that there were several plastic Glock Model 19 magazines but no Glock pistols.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you have any Glocks?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Mr. Colonel, but none of those I have. Those guns of Glock sell very quick, when I am getting one.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then Andy spotted a pistol in a well-made holster that looked different from the others. Withdrawing it from the holster, Andy was pleased to see a SIG P228 9mm pistol in nearly new condition. It looked just like the U.S. Army&#x2013;issue P228s that the CID agent...</p><h2>The Gift of Living in the Divine Will in the Writings of Luisa Piccarreta: An Inquiry into the Early Ecumenical Councils, and into Patristic, Scholastic and Contemporary Theology</h2><p>Known for his previous best selling Catholic books such as, The Splendor of Creation and Proper Catholic Perspectives, Rev. Dr. Joseph L. Iannuzzi's long awaited book, The Gift of Living in the Divine Will in the Writings of Luisa Piccarreta, is finally available. Over 700 pages in length, Iannuzzi's thoroughly documented and highly researched account of Piccarreta's life is unparalleled in its scope and depth, and is the definitive work of the life and writings of Luisa Piccarreta. Born in 1865 in Corato, Italy, Luisa Piccarreta began receiving revelations at age 12 and was called by God to become a victim soul. At a very tender age God spoke to her about a gift he wishes to bestow upon the world that will set it free and inaugurate an Era of World Peace. God refers to this gift as &#x201c;Living in the Divine Will&#x201d;, for it is through an act of God&#x2019;s will that the earth will be made pure and mankind will become holy. Just as God the Father created the world, and the Son of God redeemed it, so the Holy Spirit will sanctify it through the outpouring of this gift. According to Luisa&#x2019;s revelations, although God created us without us, he cannot save us without us. Therefore, he reveals himself to Luisa so that through her, we may come to know the loving gift he has prepared for us &#x2013; the gift that will restore us to the holiness that Adam and Even enjoyed in Eden, and that will set all creation free. St. Paul affirms that &#x201c;all creation groans with eager longings, waiting to be set free from its slavery to corruption and enjoy the glorious freedom of the sons of God,&#x201d; and God tells Luisa that those who live in the Divine Will will be those sons of God who set creation free. This book is divided into 7 chapters. Chapter 1 presents a biographical sketch of Luisa&#x2019;s life; Chapters 2-4 explore the importance of the gift of Living in the Divine Will; Chapters 5-7 compare this gift to the Church&#x2019;s Eastern and Western traditions. Because this book bears the ecclesiastical &#x201c;seal of approval&#x201d; of the Pontifical University of Rome that is authorized by the Holy See, it enjoys a particular status that ensures sound doctrinal content for the Christian faithful. If you are familiar with the extraordinary life of Luisa Piccarreta, then this book will truly bring you deeper into her life and the gift of the &#x201c;Divine Will&#x201d;. If you are not, then you are truly in for a special and extraordinary experience that will change your life. It is a story perhaps unparalleled in the history of mystical theology, written by whom many consider the Church&#x2019;s most authoritative person on the subject.</p><p></p><h2>The Gloom Looms: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 10-12 (The Slippery Slope; The Grim Grotto; The Penultimate Peril)</h2><p><p><strong>NOW A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES</strong></p><p>A Warning from the Publisher:</p><p>If you have come this far, it is likely too late.

The first book in the series introduces Dunnett&#x2019;s unforgettable antihero as he returns to Scotland with a wild plan to redeem his reputation and save his home.<br> &nbsp;<br> The year is 1547. Scotland is clinging to independence after a humiliating English invasion. Paradoxically, the country&#x2019;s freedom may depend on a man who stands accused of treason. He is Francis Crawford of Lymond, a scapegrace nobleman of crooked felicities and murderous talents, with a scholar&#x2019;s erudition and a wicked tongue. Clawing his way back into a country that has outlawed him, and to a family that has turned its back on him, Lymond will prove that he has both the will and the cunning to clear his name and defend his people&#x2014;no matter the cost.</p><p>DOROTHY DUNNETT was born in Dunfermline, Scotland. She is the author of the Francis Crawford of Lymond novels; the House of Niccol� novels; seven mysteries; <i>King Hereafter</i>, an epic novel about Macbeth; and the text of <i>The Scottish Highlands</i>, a book of photographs by David Paterson, on which she collaborated with her husband, Sir Alastair Dunnett.&nbsp;In 1992 she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to literature.&nbsp;Lady Dunnett died in 2001."Lymond is back."<br><br> It was. known soon after the Sea-Catte reached Scotland from Campvere with an illicit cargo and a man she should not have carried.<br><br> "Lymond is in Scotland."<br><br> It was said by busy men preparing for war against England, with contempt, with disgust; with a side-slipping look at one of their number. "I hear the Lord Culter's young brother is back." Only sometimes a woman's voice would say it with a different note, and then laugh a little.<br><br> Lymond's own men had known he was coming. Waiting for him in Edinburgh they wondered briefly, without concern, how he proposed to penetrate a walled city to reach them.<br><br> When the Sea-Catte came in, Mungo Tennant, citizen and smuggler of Edinburgh, knew nothing of these things or of its passenger. He made his regular private adjustment from douce gentility to illegal trading; and soon a boatload of taxless weapons, bales of velvet and Bordeaux wine was being rowed on a warm August night over the Nor' Loch which guarded the north flank of Edinburgh, and toward the double cellar beneath Mungo's house.<br><br> Among the reeds of the Nor' Loch, where the snipe and the woodcock lay close and the baillies' swans raised their grey necks, a man quietly stripped to silk shirt and hose and stood listening, before slidding softly into the water.<br><br> Across four hundred feet of black lake, friezelike on their ridge, towered the houses of Edinburgh. Tonight the Castle on its pinnacle was fully lit, laying constellations on the water; for within, the Governor of Scotland the Earl of Arran was listening to report after report of the gathering English army about to invade him.<br><br> Below the Castle, the house of the Queen Mother also showed lights. The late King's French widow, Mary of Guise, was sleepless too over the feared attack, for the redheaded baby Queen for whom Arran governed was her daughter. And England's purpose was to force a betrothal between the child Queen Mary and the boy King Edward, aged nine, and to abduct the four-year-old fianc?e if chance offered. The burned thatch, the ruined stonework, the blackened face of Holyrood Palace showed where already, in other years, invading armies from England had made their point, but not their capture.<br><br> Few civic cares troubled Mungo Tennant, awaiting his cargo, except that the ceaseless renewal of war against England made a watch at the gates much too stringent; and the total defeat by England thirty-four years since at Flodden had caused high walls to be flung around Edinburgh which were damnably inopportune for a smuggler. And for Crawford of Lymond, now parting the flat waters of the Nor' Loch like an oriflamme in the wake of the boat. For where a smuggler's load could pierce a city's defences, so could an outlawed rebel, whose life would be forfeit if caught.<br><br> Ahead, the boat scraped on mud and was lifted silently shoreward. The rowers unloaded. Burdened feet trod on grass, crossed a garden, encompassed an obstacle, and were silent within the underground shaft leading to the cellar below the cellar in Mungo's house. The swimmer, collared with duckweed, grounded, shook himself, and unseen followed gently into, and out of the same house. Crawford of Lymond was in Edinburgh.<br><br> Once there, it was simple. In a small room in the High Street he changed fast into sober, smothering clothes and was fed two months' news, in voracious detail, by those serving him. ". . . And so the Governor's expecting the English in three weeks and is fair flittering about like a hen with its throat cut. . . . You're gey wet," said the spokesman.<br><br> "I," said Lymond, in the voice unmistakably his which honeyed his most lethal thoughts, "I am a narwhal looking for my virgin. I have sucked up the sea like Charybdis and failing other entertainment will spew it three times daily, for a fee. Tell me again, precisely, what you have just said about Mungo Tennant."<br><br> They told him, and received their orders, and then he left, pausing on the threshold to pin the dark cloak about his chin. "Shy," said Lymond with simplicity, "as a dogtooth violet." And he was gone.<br><br> In his tall house in Gosford Close with the boar's head in chief over the lintel, Mungo Tennant, wealthy and respectable burgher, had invited a neighbour and his friend to call. They sat on carved chairs, with their feet on a Kurdistan carpet, ate their way through capon and quails, chickens, pigeons and strawberries, cherries, apples and warden pears, and noticed none of these things, nor even the hour, being at grips with a noble and irresistible argument.<br><br> At ten o'clock, the rest of the household went to bed.<br><br> At ten-thirty, Mungo's steward answered a rasp at the door and found Hob Hewat, the water carrier.<br><br> The steward asked Hob, in the vernacular, digressing every second or third word, what he wanted.<br><br> Hob said he had been told to bring water for the sow.<br><br> The steward denied it. Hob insisted. The steward described what instead he might do with the water and Hob described in detail how he had ruined his spine raising the steward's undistinguished water from the well. Mungo, above, thumped on the floor to stop the racket and the steward, cursing, gave in. He led the way to the apartment beneath the stairs where lived Mungo's great sow, the badge of his house, the pet and idiotic pig's apple of his eye, and waited while Hob Hewat filled its water trough. He then sat down suddenly under an annihilating tap on the head.<br><br> Hob, who had done all he had been paid to do, disappeared.<br><br> The steward slipped to the floor, and stayed there.<br><br> The sow approached her water dish, sniffed it with increasing favour, and inserted both her nose and her front trotters therein.<br><br> Crawford of Lymond tied up the steward, left the stye, and climbed the stairs to Mungo Tennant's apartments.<br><br> In the gratified presence of their host, Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch and Tom Erskine were still hard at it. Buccleuch, beaked like a macaw, was a baroque and mighty Scots Lowlander with a tough mind, a voice like Saint Columba's, and one of the biggest estates on the Scottish Border. Erskine, much the younger, pink, stocky and vehement, was a son of Lord Erskine, who was head of one of the families nearest the throne, and captain of the Queen's fortress of Stirling.<br><br> "Just wait," Buccleuch was roaring. "Just wait, man. Protector Somerset will get his damned English rabble together and march into Scotland up the east coast. And he'll tell off his commander, Lord Wharton, to get his Cumberland English together and invade us at the same time up the west coast. And half the west coast landowners are pensioners of the English already and won't resist 'em. And all the rest of us'll be over here at Edinburgh fighting Ned Somerset-"<br><br> "Not all of us," said Erskine neatly.<br><br> Buccleuch's whiskers promenaded. "Who'll stay in the west that's worth a docken?"<br><br> "Andrew Hunter of Ballaggan?"<br><br> "Christ. Andrew's a nice, gentlemanly lad, but his estate's been bled dry; and as for the ill-armed crew he calls followers- Man, they'd lay on a battlefield like dandruff."<br><br> "The third Baron Culter?" suggested Tom Erskine, and Buccleuch got the derisive note and turned red at the wattle.<br><br> "I know fine the cheeky clack of the court," shouted Buccleuch. "They say Culter's not to be trusted."<br><br> Tom Erskine lifted the broad, brocade shoulders. "They say his younger brother's not to be trusted."<br><br> "Lymond! We know all about Lymond. Rieving and ruttery and all manner of vice-"<br><br> "And treason."<br><br> "And treason. But treason's not Lord Culter's dish. There are those that want to take time and men to hunt down Lymond and his band of murderers; and those that demand that Culter should lead them as proof of his loyalty. But if Richard Crawford of Culter won't interfere; says he has better business to attend to and refuses flatly to hound down his brother baying like the Wild Jagd, that still doesn't make him a traitor." And inflating the great chasms of his cheeks, Buccleuch added, "Anyway, Culter's just got married. D'ye blame him for keeping his shield on the hook and his family blunders all tied up at the back of the armory?"<br><br> "Damn it," said Tom Erskine, annoyed, "I don't blame him for anything. It isn't my fault. And if it's that black Irish beauty he married, I don't expect he'd notice if the Protector knocked on the front gate at Midculter and asked for a drink of water. But-"<br><br> The large red face had calmed down. "You're dead right, of course," said Buccleuch cordially. "In fact you've given me a wee notion or two I can use to the fellow himself. If Culter's going to be in credit at court at all, he'll need to bring himself to capture that honey-faced de'il."<br><br> Mungo Tennant, the silent and flattered host, was able to make respectful comment at last. "Crawford of Lymond, Sir Wat?" he said. "Now, he's not in this country, as I heard. He's in the Low Countries, I believe. And when he'll be back, if ever, God knows. . . . Bless us, what's that?"<br><br> It was only a sneeze; but a sneeze outside the door of their chamber, which dislimned every shade of their privacy. Tom Erskine got there first, the other two at his heels. The room beyond was empty, but the door of Mungo's bedroom was ajar. Taking a candle like a banner in his fist, Erskine rushed in.<br><br> His hair soft as a nestling's, his eyes graceless with malice, Lymond was watching him in a silver mirror. Before Erskine could call, Buccleuch and Mungo Tennant had piled in beside him and Lymond had taken two steps to the far door, there to linger, hand on latch and the blade of his sword held twinkling at breast level as they jumped, weaponless, to face him, and then fell back.<br><br> "As my lady of Suffolk saith," said Lymond gently, "God is a marvellous man." Eyes of cornflower blue rested thoughtfully on Sir Wat. "I had fallen behind with the gossip. . . . Nouvelle amour, nouvelle affection; nouvelles fleurs parmi l'herbe nouvelle. Tell Richard his bride has yet to meet her brother-in-law, her Sea-Catte, her Sea-Scorpion, beautiful in the breeding season. What a pity you didn't wear your swords."<br><br> Rage mottled Buccleuch's face. "Ye murdering cur. . . . You'll end this night-"<br><br> "I know. Flensed, basted and flayed, and off to hang on a six-shilling gibbet-keep your distance-but not tonight. The city is not full great, but it hath good baths within him. And tonight the frogs and mice fight, eh, Mungo?"<br><br> "Man's mad," said Buccleuch positively. He had managed to pick up a firedog.<br><br> "Mungo doesn't think so," said Lymond. "His mind is on fleshly lusts and his treasure." And certainly, the jennet fur at his neck warped with sweat, Mungo Tennant was gaping at the intruder.<br><br> Lymond smiled back. "Be careful," he said. "Pits are yawning publicly at your feet. O mea cella, vale, you know . . ." And suddenly, it came to Mungo what he was threatening.<br><br> "Don't linger, I pray you, cuckoo, while you run away," said the sage. Mungo Tennant said nothing. He rushed toward Lymond, collided with Tom Erskine on the way, and falling, sat on the candle. There was a moment's indescribable hubbub while the three men and the firedog blundered cursing into each other in the dark; then they got to the far door and wrenched it open. The corridor as far as the stairhead was quite empty, and the light feet running downward were already some distance away. They hurled themselves after him.<br><br> They were three floors above the ground, and the staircase was spiral. The spilth of Buccleuch's bellow rattled the pewter in the kitchens; Tom Erskine shouted and Mungo piped like a hen-whistle. The servants on their pallets heard and started up; tallows flared and a patter of bare feet began on the rushes below.<br><br> Mungo's sow heard it too. Drunk as a bishop, she hurtled stairward as the first of the servants arrived. Great blanket ears flapping and rump arched like a Druid at sunrise, she hurled herself at them as Lymond and his pursuers fled down. She bounced once off the newel post, scrabbled once on the flags, trotters smoking, then shot Mungo Tennant backward, squealing thickly in a liberated passion of ham-handed adoration. Mungo sat down, Buccleuch fell on top of him and Tom Erskine swooped headfirst over them both, landing on the pack of unkempt heads jamming the stair foot like stooks at a threshing. Winnowing through them, utterly unremarked in the uproar, was Lymond.<br><br> Screaming, squealing and grunting, the impacted cluster swayed on the stairs, torn and surging like rack where the pig unseen hooked the bare feet from under them. Buccleuch was the first to get free, grey whiskers overhanging the swarm like a Chinese kite at a carnival. "Lymond!" he shrieked. "Where's he got to?"<br><br> They scoured the house in the end without a trace of him, although they found Mungo's steward mute and bound in the pighouse. "Damn it!" said Buccleuch furiously. "The windows were barred and the door lockit-he must be here. Where's your cellar?"<br><br> Mungo's face was spotty under the pig-spit. "I've looked there. It's empty."<br><br> "Well, let's look again," snapped Buccleuch, and, was there before Tennant could stop him. "What's that?"<br><br> It was, undoubtedly, a trap door. In bitterest necessity, Mungo Tennant held them up for ten minutes protesting: he claimed it was sealed; it was ornamental; it was locked and unused.

It&#x2019;s been several years since Jess and Hannah Ballard foiled a cataclysmic prophecy that could have destroyed their fellow Durupinen, an ancient clan of women who allow spirits to cross between the worlds of the living and the dead. The girls swore, after the devastation and chaos they endured, they would never get caught up in the inner workings of the Durupinen again.</p><p>They were wrong.</p><p>After breaking the code of secrecy and facing the judgement of the High Council, Jess and Hannah have no choice but to become Trackers, working to take down those who would exploit the spirit world for profit or power. Their first assignment takes them into the deep South, where Jeremiah Campbell, a self-proclaimed spiritual guru, lures wealthy and desperate devotees with promises of a deeper connection with the dead. As the girls go undercover, it soon becomes clear that Campbell is not merely the con artist they suspected him to be, and that they, and the spirit world they are sworn to protect, are once again in unimaginable danger.</p><p><i>Whispers of the Walker</i> is the first spine-tingling installment in "The Gateway Trackers" series by E.E.

I did, several decades ago, and it was the most important decision I&#x2019;ve ever made.

But this is the moment you can turn it all around.<br> <br> It doesn&#x2019;t matter how tough things seem, how badly you&#x2019;ve messed up, how many bridges you&#x2019;ve burned or hearts you&#x2019;ve broken, including your own.

If your life has been pretty good up until now&#x2014;if you&#x2019;ve been blessed with a supportive family, a good education, and some degree of success&#x2014;then I will simply show you how to accelerate your journey. And if you&#x2019;ve been successful beyond your wildest dreams, but find yourself still feeling like something is missing, I can help you to discover the secret that will make all of it meaningful.<br> <br> I&#x2019;ve come to understand that there is an unimaginable power within each and every one of us. For some, it may seem like only a tiny, flickering flame, almost snuffed out by the negativity in the world around us and the limiting beliefs in our own minds. But my goal in this book is to fan this flame, to make it bright and strong and powerful so that it radiates through you in everything you do. I&#x2019;d like to share my story with you, because if I can get there from where I was, you can get there from here, whatever &#x201c;here&#x201d; looks like for you.<br> <br> * * *<br> <br> In one of our family albums, there is a photo of me, one year old, with a bottle of beer wedged between my chubby knees and a cigarette hanging out of my mouth. I&#x2019;m sure it was just a joke on my parents&#x2019; part, but unfortunately it was prescient. I started drinking in eighth grade, spent my teenage years in and out of jail, and was kicked out of three schools. Between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, I survived eight car accidents, all of them alcohol-related.<br> <br> I was not the first in my family to have a drinking problem. My dad&#x2019;s parents were both alcoholics, and he was made a ward of the state of California at the age of thirteen. Sure enough, he grew up to become an alcoholic himself, and my mother, although sweet and loving, was unable to do anything but support his habit.<br> <br> At the age of fourteen, I ran away from home, traveling from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Lexington, Kentucky, with just a few dollars in my pocket, staying in Lexington a few weeks before a kind priest helped me to find my way home. That was the first of a number of attempts to leave it all behind.<br> <br> In my early twenties, I married Lisa, my teenage sweetheart. It was a drunken, spur-of-the moment decision on my part that threw together two lost and lonely young people who didn&#x2019;t really know themselves or each other that well. I was a terrible husband&#x2014; unfaithful, eventually unemployed, and fast adopting my father&#x2019;s worst habits as I drank and took drugs to dull my guilt over the disaster I was making of my marriage. In the midst of this chaos, Lisa became pregnant.<br> <br> When my daughter Michelle was just two months old, I looked at myself in the mirror and was overwhelmed by shame and humiliation at what a loser I&#x2019;d become, and the fact that everyone knew it. So I ran away from it all, just as I had as a teenager and many times since. Only this time, Lisa had had enough. When I called her after a week of partying, she refused to take me back.<br> <br> Driving aimlessly through town, I ended up at the church where we had gotten married. I wasn&#x2019;t a believer, but I was so desperate that I stumbled up the steps, only to find the door locked. So I sat out on those steps and I demanded that if God was real, he should manifest right there&#x2014;then, and only then, I would believe, and I would change my ways. Nothing happened. But by the grace of God, the next day I found myself in an AA meeting, and for the first time in months, I felt a stirring of hope.<br> <br> By the spring of 1983, I was divorced and felt like I was dying inside, although I would never admit that to anyone. I had made a resolution to turn my<br> <br> life around, whatever it took, but I honestly didn&#x2019;t know if I could survive the pain in the meantime. I put on a tough face, got a job waiting tables, and dutifully fulfilled my child-support obligations. I joined a program and stopped drinking. I started reading every self-help book I could get my hands on. But the noose around my heart grew tighter and tighter the harder I tried to break through. I was living in a constant state of fear and depression. In hindsight, I think I was experiencing the accumulated pain of all my childhood wounds, but most immediately, the source of my anguish was my separation from my wife and infant daughter.<br> <br> It was all my fault. That was the worst part. I had created this mess, and now I had to survive long enough to fix it. At one of my lowest moments, a good friend offered to introduce me to a man who he thought could help. He scribbled an address on a piece of paper.<br> <br> So it was that I found myself driving my 1971 Ford Pinto through a nondescript suburban neighborhood. Although it was a cold and rainy northern California day, I had to keep the car window open, because the driver&#x2019;s door had been damaged, and would not stay closed unless I drove with one arm out of the window, holding it shut. I pulled up outside the modest home of this mystery man with one wet arm and wildly disheveled hair.<br> <br> My friend had told me that this man could help me, but it would cost me $50 an hour, an awful lot of money to me at the time. I barely scraped by on the $2000 a month I made waiting tables in two different restaurants, and I was $40,000 in debt. But I was desperate, so I took a deep breath, scraped my wet hair off my face, and rang the doorbell.<br> <br> A middle-aged guy answered the door, shook my hand, and introduced himself. I&#x2019;m sure he told me his name, but strangely, for decades later I could not recall it, and so I always thought of him as the Mystery Man. What I do recall was the feeling I got when I first laid eyes on him. My heart sank. I&#x2019;d been hoping for a white- bearded wise man, or an exotic-looking mystic like those I&#x2019;d read about in my self- help books. This guy certainly didn&#x2019;t look like a miracle-worker&#x2014;he looked more like a schoolteacher or an accountant. He invited me in to his kitchen, and offered me a cup of coffee. Taking a seat opposite me, he sat quietly for a moment, and then, in a soft but surprisingly commanding voice, he made a proposal:<br> <br> &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s going to work. We&#x2019;ll meet one hour a week for seven weeks. Between our meetings, I&#x2019;ll expect you to do just a little work to prepare for the next. In the seventh week, you will receive a gift that will forever change your life.&#x201d;<br> <br> Shrinking back in my seat, all I could think about was seven times fifty&#x2014;$350 that I didn&#x2019;t have. I also noted the simplicity of the small house, with its well-worn furniture and unremarkable location, which did not give me much confidence in this man&#x2019;s ability to materialize anything. It all just seemed a bit far-fetched.<br> <br> I must have looked unconvinced, because he suddenly pushed back his chair, stood up, and leaned across the table, so close that his face was almost touching mine. &#x201c;You do this and you will get everything you want!&#x201d;<br> <br> His intensity took me aback, but something in his demeanor was compelling. Maybe this unassuming mystery man really did know the secret to getting my life back on track. One thing I knew for sure was that it couldn&#x2019;t get much worse. And I had nowhere else to turn.<br> <br> As I sat there trying to decide if this was crazy or if it just might work, I remembered how one of the inspirational authors I&#x2019;d been reading said that when you spend money on your mind it is not an expense but an investment. No one had ever invested in my mind, so I figured I&#x2019;d take a chance and see if it paid off. Besides, I told myself, if I didn&#x2019;t like the first week I wouldn&#x2019;t return, so I would only be down $50. Deep down, however, I knew that this wasn&#x2019;t really about my mind. It was about the unrelenting pain in my heart. I scribbled out a check.</p><h2>Every Month Is a New Year: Celebrations Around the World</h2><p>In many places around the globe, the new year starts on January 1. But not everywhere! Chinese New Year is celebrated in January or February. Iranians observe Nowruz in March. For Thai people, Songkran occurs in April. Ethiopians greet the new year at Enkutatash in September. All these diverse cultural, regional, and religious observances, and many others, have deep-rooted traditions and treasured customs. <br> <br>Acclaimed poet Marilyn Singer has created a lively poetry collection that highlights sixteen of these fascinating festivities, some well-known and some less familiar. Together with Susan L. Roth s captivating collage illustrations, the poems take readers to the heart of these beloved holidays. Every month of the year, somewhere in the world people celebrate with joy and good wishes for a happy new year.</p><p><p>MARILYN SINGER is the author of more than one hundred children's and young adult books in a variety of genres, including many poetry collections.

Readers must turn the book on its side to enjoy the wall-calendar dimensions of each spread, all of which feature a short, gently-rhyming poem told from an individual child s point of view about commemorations from Times Square to Chile, China, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Jordan, New Zealand, Scotland, Spain, and Thailand. They re organized chronologically across the Gregorian calendar, as a piece about Wep Ronpet (as marked in Ancient Egypt and now some U.S. communities) explains: "Everyone believes in a different beginning. / The Year may start for me, for you, anew in January, April, May, / or in some other month, on some other day. . . . But what is true and what is clear is that all of us hope for a luminous year." The collage illustrations using paper sourced from across the globe are spectacular, with culturally distinctive elements yet a consistent style, and the back matter is stellar and solid, with additional information, pronunciations, a map, and thorough source notes. This complete package is an illuminating and respectful appreciation of both our global uniqueness and our commonality. --Starred review, <i>Booklist</i><br><br>Fittingly taking the shape of a calendar, this graceful grouping of more than a dozen poems showcases new year celebrations, both secular and religious, from across the globe and throughout the year. Lines from "Smashing the Pots," about the Kemetic holiday of Wep Ronpet, crystallize the book s intent: "Everyone believes in a different beginning./ But what is true and what is clear/ is that all of us hope for a luminous year." The poems are framed by calendar-style grids filled with thematic collage elements, and dramatic scenes of shared meals (for Nowruz in Iran), flying kites (for Matariki in New Zealand), and other festivities appear in the main images above. Closing notes thoroughly explore the holidays Singer introduces, closing out a lovely collection that both looks back at tradition and forward to new beginnings, wherever one might live. --Starred review, <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Block Party 2: The Afterparty</h2><p>Teenagers, Ahmir and Ahmad Pierson are the offspring of Newark&#39;s infamous ghetto legend Donald &#34;Cashmere&#34; Pierson. Ghetto fame and admiration have been a part of their lives for as far back as they both can remember, thanks to Cashmere. Cashmere&#39;s addiction to the fast life and the love for his two sons have always conflicted but the love his sons have for him has always been unconditional. Nothing in the world means more to them than their father whom they&#39;ve always held on a pedestal. Ahmir and Ahmad&#39;s lives change drastically after they both witness a horrifying act that they&#39;ll never forget. The old cliche&#39; is true &#34;for every action there is an opposite, but equal reaction.&#34; What becomes of two traumatized teens whose hearts are filled with vengeance? What does their future hold for them? Or do they even have a future?</p><p>Al-Saadiq Banks is a Best Selling Author of nine titles, which include, No Exit, Block Party1-4, Sincerely Yours, Caught em Slippin&#x2019;, Strapped and Young Gunz.

Stearns&#x2019;s journey took much more than a long flight to Africa. It took answering God&#x2019;s call on his life, a call that tore him out of his corner office at one of America&#x2019;s most prestigious corporations, to walk with the poorest of the poor in our world.</p><p>Stearns&#x2019;s compelling story demonstrates that the <em>whole</em> gospel was always meant to be a world-changing social revolution, a revolution that begins with each one of us.</p></p><p><p>Richard Stearns went from success to significance when he left the corporate world behind to become president of World Vision U.S. in 1998. After 20 years as the longest-serving CEO of the Christian relief and development organization, he plans to retire in January 2019. Stearns holds a bachelor's degree from Cornell University and an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. His professional career included leadership roles at Gillette, Parker Brothers Games, The Franklin Mint, and Lenox Inc., where he became president and chief executive officer in 1995. Stearns brought corporate best practices to World Vision, where he inspired a culture of outcome-focused management. His lasting legacy is his leadership in calling on the Church in America to respond to some of the greatest needs of our time, notably the HIV and AIDS pandemic and the global refugee crisis. Stearns and his wife, Rene�, have five children and five grandchildren and live in Bellevue, Washington.</p>'Read this compelling story and urgent call for change--Richard Stearns is a contemporary Amos crying 'let justice roll down like waters....'

It was day two of the First Continental Congress&#x2014;Tuesday, September 6, 1774. Delegates from twelve of America&#x2019;s thirteen colonies had assembled at Carpenters&#x2019; Hall in Philadelphia to officially react to deteriorating relations between Great Britain and its American colonies. Decades of disagreement had led to a tense crisis between the colonies and the Mother Country. In an attempt to resolve the issues, the colonies had dispatched delegations to Philadelphia&#x2019;s grand assembly, which was the first of its kind in America. Opening deliberations had been cordial and productive. The delegates had voted to call their assembly the &#x201c;Continental Congress,&#x201d; had appointed Virginia delegate Peyton Randolph as its president, and had agreed to meet in Philadelphia&#x2019;s Carpenters&#x2019; Hall. Then came day two&#x2014;and the opening display of cooperation sank into a mire of argument.1<br> <br>At issue was the question of how to count votes. Large colonies wanted their large populations to count for more. Small colonies wanted equal representation. Amid the debate, Philadelphia&#x2019;s church bells began tolling at the news that British forces were bombarding the city of Boston. It was a false alarm, but it added to an atmosphere of anxiety in Congress. The dark mood may have been heightened by the deadly risk each delegate faced by simply being there. The unprecedented assembly was unauthorized by Britain&#x2019;s King George III or the British Parliament. Among the delegates in attendance were men who believed the British government&#x2019;s treatment of the American colonies amounted to tyranny. Such politics were deemed treasonous by some, and the delegates undoubtedly knew what grisly fate sometimes befell traitors to the Crown.2<br> <br>If arrested and convicted of high treason, a delegate might find himself in Great Britain&#x2019;s notorious Tower of London, waiting to be &#x201c;drawn and quartered.&#x201d; If so sentenced, he would first be hanged until almost dead, then cut down and disemboweled. While still alive, he would be forced to watch his intestines burned. Then, one by one, other bodily organs would be torturously removed until death finally occurred. Afterward, his corpse would be beheaded and his torso cut into quarters. Finally, his head would be publicly mounted on a post. &#x201c;Let us prepare for the worst,&#x201d; New Jersey delegate Abraham Clark at one point advised a colleague; &#x201c;we can Die here but once.&#x201d; Debate on how to count votes concluded with a consensus&#x2014;a single vote for each delegation&#x2014;but the tension among delegates led some to fear that the Continental Congress might dissolve in disunity.3<br> <br>Then Massachusetts delegate Thomas Cushing made a motion. Cushing was a forty-nine-year-old Boston lawyer, a Harvard alumnus, and a successful merchant. A member of the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, he was a prominent champion of Colonial political rights&#x2014;always &#x201c;busy in the interest of liberty,&#x201d; according to a colleague. He observed the second day&#x2019;s tense deliberations with the savvy of a seasoned statesman&#x2014;then he acted. From now on, Cushing formally proposed, Congress should officially open its day with prayer. The motion reflected Cushing&#x2019;s personal faith&#x2014;he was a deacon at Boston&#x2019;s Old South Congregational Church&#x2014;and it also reflected the common faith of most delegates. Even so, Cushing&#x2019;s motion for prayer provoked an immediate challenge.4<br> <br>Concerns were voiced by John Rutledge of South Carolina and John Jay of New York. A thirty-five-year-old London-educated attorney, Rutledge was renowned for his eloquence and political acumen. The older of two brothers in the South Carolina delegation, he would eventually become his state&#x2019;s governor and later the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. He was anything but a critic of Christianity: tutored by clergymen as a child, he was an Anglican who worshipped at Charleston&#x2019;s St. Michael&#x2019;s Church.5<br> <br>John Jay was also a believer. At twenty-eight, the New York attorney was a prominent member of New York City&#x2019;s Trinity Church. Descended from French Huguenots who had been driven from Europe for their Protestant faith, he would eventually become president of the American Bible Society. Like Rutledge, he too would someday become a governor and a U.S. chief justice, and&#x2014;like Rutledge&#x2014;he made no argument for separation of church and state. They were merely concerned that a congressional prayer might increase disunity because so many Christian denominations were represented in Congress. Could the delegates unite in a congressional act of worship?6<br> <br>Massachusetts delegate Samuel Adams believed so&#x2014;and he quickly rose to support Cushing&#x2019;s prayer motion. By almost any measure, Sam Adams was the most famous advocate of Colonial rights in America&#x2014;and the most controversial. Politics was his passion, and he was a master of the craft. An instrumental leader in the Massachusetts legislature, he was viewed by many as Colonial America&#x2019;s leading defender, but Britain&#x2019;s leaders called him an &#x201c;angel of darkness.&#x201d; He too was devout. Raised in a family of committed Christians, he had considered the ministry in his youth. Now, as a middle-aged Calvinist, he took his faith seriously, and was said to possess &#x201c;the dogmatism of a priest.&#x201d;7<br> <br>He was &#x201c;no Bigot,&#x201d; Sam Adams told his fellow delegates. He &#x201c;could hear a Prayer from a Gentleman of Piety and Virtue, who was at the same Time a Friend to his Country&#x201d;&#x2014;and he heartily endorsed the call to congressional prayer. Congress agreed&#x2014;and promptly passed Cushing&#x2019;s motion. Beginning the next day, the Continental Congress would officially open every day&#x2019;s session with prayer. But who would be the first to pray? In an obvious display of congressional unity, Samuel Adams, a Puritan Congregationalist, nominated an Anglican clergyman to offer the first official prayer. Congress approved his nomination and promptly sent an invitation to the selected minister.8<br> <br>His name was Jacob Duch�, and at age thirty-seven, he may have been the most popular preacher in Philadelphia. The Anglican pastor of Philadelphia&#x2019;s prestigious Christ Church, Duch� was the son of a former Philadelphia mayor and brother-in-law to congressional delegate Francis Hopkinson. A graduate of Cambridge University, he was well educated, served as professor of oratory at the College of Philadelphia, and was renowned for his eloquence in the pulpit. The invitation to open Congress with prayer was a measure of his prominence, but carried genuine risk: Duch� was a minister in the Church of England, Britain&#x2019;s official state church, and accepting the invitation could have put him in harm&#x2019;s way with the British government. He accepted anyway.9<br> <br>The next morning&#x2014;Wednesday, September 7, 1774 &#x2014; the pastor appeared before the delegates attired in Anglican clergyman&#x2019;s robes. When the Congress was called to order, he opened the day&#x2019;s session with a formal prayer, then followed it by reading from the Bible. The Bible passage Duch� read was the Anglican &#x201c;collect&#x201d; for the day&#x2014;the scripture scheduled for that day in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer&#x2014;Psalm 35:<br> <br><i>Plead my cause, O</i>LORD, <i>with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me. Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.</i><br><br><i>Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the</i>LORD<i>chase them. Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the</i>lord<i>persecute them.</i><br><br><i>For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul. Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall. And my soul shall be joyful in the</i>LORD: <i>it shall rejoice in his salvation. ...Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.</i><br><br><i>Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the</i>lord<i>be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.</i>10<br> <br>Assembled in the intimidating shadow of Royal power, the delegates found the relevance of Psalm 35 to be extraordinary. It was all the more striking for those who realized that particular Psalm had been placed in the prayer book as the reading for September seventh many years earlier. &#x201c;It seemed as if Heaven had ordained that Psalm to be read on that morning,&#x201d; Massachusetts&#x2019; John Adams wrote his wife. Duch�&#x2019;s prayers were apparently equally moving. The Secretary of the Continental Congress, Charles Thompson, managed to record one of them as it echoed in the stillness of Carpenters&#x2019; Hall.<br> <br><i>O! Lord, our heavenly father, King of Kings and Lord of lords: who dost from thy throne behold all the dwellers upon earth and reignest with power supreme &amp; uncontrouled over all kingdoms, empires and governments, look down in mercy, we beseech thee, upon these our American states who have fled to thee from the road of the oppressor and thrown themselves upon thy gracious protection, desiring henceforth to be dependent only on thee.</i><br><br><i>To thee they have appealed for the righteousness of their Cause; to Thee do they look up, for that countenance &amp; support which Thou alone canst give. Take them, therefore, Heavenly Father, under thy nurturing care: give them wisdom in council, valour in the field. Defeat the malicious designs of our cruel adversaries. Convince them of the unrighteousness of their cause. And if they persist in their sanguinary purposes, O! let the voice of thy unerring justice sounding in their hearts constrain them to drop the weapons of war from their enerved hands in the day of battle.</i><br><br><i>Be thou present, O God of Wisdom and direct the counsels of this honourable Assembly. Enable them to settle things upon the best and surest foundation, that the scene of blood may be speedily closed; that harmony and peace may effectually be restored, and truth and justice, religion and piety prevail and flourish amongst thy people. Preserve the health of their bodies and the vigour of their minds; shower down upon them and the millions they represent such temporal blessings as Thou seest expedient for them in this world, and crown them with everlasting glory in the world to come. All this we ask in the name and through the merits of Jesus Christ thy son, Our Saviour, Amen.</i>11<br> <br>Some delegates were moved to tears. Duch�&#x2019;s prayer, marveled John Adams, was &#x201c;as pertinent, as affectionate, as sublime, as devout, as I ever heard offered up to Heaven. He filled every Bosom present.&#x201d; Connecticut&#x2019;s Silas Deane said the congressional devotion was &#x201c;worth riding One Hundred Mile to hear.&#x201d; On a motion by New York&#x2019;s James Duane, the delegates unanimously voted to award Duch� the official thanks of Congress.

It was also the flame of inspiration that fired the American quest for freedom. The common people of Colonial America and their leaders would soon establish a new nation, and it would be founded on an old Book&#x2014;the Bible.13<br> <br>� 2010 Rod Gragg</p><h2>The Quilt Walk</h2><p>It&#x2019;s 1863 and 10-year-old Emmy Blue Hatchett has been told by her father that soon their family will leave their farm, family, and friends in Illinois, and travel west to a new home in Colorado. It&#x2019;s difficult leaving family and friends behind. They might not see one another ever again. When Emmy&#x2019;s grandmother comes to say goodbye, she gives Emmy a special gift to keep her occupied on the trip. The journey by wagon train is long and full of hardships. But the Hatchetts persevere and reach their destination in Colorado, ready to start their new life.</p><p>No Bio<br><br>No BioGr 3-6-Ten-year-old Emmy Blue's life on a farm near Quincy, Illinois, is just fine until her father announces that the family is moving to Colorado where gold is being mined. He hopes to build a store and sell supplies to miners. Emmy's mother, Meggie, is not happy about the move and having to say good-bye to family and friends but, like other women of her time, does as her husband wishes. Emmy's Uncle Will and Aunt Catherine travel west with them. The women take pride in their sewing abilities and try to interest Emmy in the handicraft, but she would rather play marbles with a boy in the wagon train. Later, she takes up quilting and is able to stitch and walk the trail at the same time. This novel is based on a true story, and one of the quilts that the family brought to Colorado is in the Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum in Golden. Snakes, Indians, wild animals and starvation are always potential threats to the group, but Emmy's family is strong and they do not give up and join the "go-backers." This is a great choice for those who enjoy Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, quilting, and strong girl stories.-Tammy Di Bartolo, Rapides Parish Library, Alexandria, LA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Older brother Taro takes matters into his own hands and, night after night, sneaks out of the camp and catches fresh fish for Jimmy to help make him strong again. <br><br>This affecting tale of courage and love is an adaptation of the author's true family story, and includes a letter to readers with more information about the historical background and inspiration.</p><p>Katie Yamasaki is a muralist, author, and teacher.

Based in Brooklyn, New York, she travels widely across the world to paint in and work with diverse communities.&nbsp; She is passionate about art as dialogue and storytelling."Illustrator Yamasaki (<i>Honda: The Boy Who Dreamed of Cars</i>), in her authorial debut, draws from her own ancestral history as she describes the family's difficulties, yet she resists dropping hints about what's to come. . .

When the two boys lie in bed at night,&nbsp;the menacing shadows of the camp's guard tower are imprinted on their blankets. The family stands poised on Taro's reclining form, while the imagined torsos of F.B.I. agents loom in a forbidding muddy background.&nbsp;One of the most moving spreads shows Taro capturing fish in a river, each fish carrying a reclining Jimmy on its back.

Next Dr. Courtois discusses trauma-driven emotional turmoil, and trauma&#39;s effects on memory, self-image, relationships, and even physical wellbeing. She then provides readers with a basic understanding of the ways in which complex trauma is diagnosed and assessed, with an explanation of all common trauma-related diagnoses-including stress disorders (such as PTSD), dissociative reactions and disorders, and frequently co-occurring issues (addictions, self-injury, sleep disorders, etc.) In the book&#39;s final section, Dr. Courtois presents rudimentary information about the ways in which complex trauma and related issues can effectively be treated, including brief explanations of all psychotherapeutic methods that might be used. Importantly, she discusses in detail the sequenced, three-stage treatment model she has developed for work with addicted survivors of complex trauma, recognizing that complex trauma and addictions are often interrelated in powerful ways, and unless both issues are addressed simultaneously, the client may not heal from either. Though It&#39;s Not You, It&#39;s What Happened to You is written for people new to the concept of complex trauma and how it may be affecting them or a loved one, clinicians will also find the work useful, relying on it as a way to bolster their own knowledge and, perhaps more importantly, as a tool for informing their traumatized clients about the degree and nature of the psychotherapeutic work to come.</p><p></p><h2>Leather Bracelets: Step-by-step instructions for 33 leather cuffs, bracelets and bangles with knots, beads, buttons and charms</h2><p>Easy-to-make designs for 33 chic leather bracelets<br><br>Make the most of one of today's hottest jewelry trends with Leather Bracelets, a collection of 33 beautiful beaded, knotted, and braided accessories that would be at home on the shelves of the most stylish designer boutiques.

Written for both beginner and experienced quilters, the book features full colour photos, step-by-step instructions and drawing that will guide you through each step of the quilting process. * Workbox * Make quilts for kids from a gift for a newborn to toddlers. These designs can be made in a day. The sampler quilt is a beginner&#39;s project using many of the blocks in the book in one design. You could just as easily keep repeating certain blocks or add more blocks that you know to vary the design. Baby Blocks is an even simpler beginner&#39;s quilt, Bugs is similar and Baby Bricks is simple enough and very effective. Here&#39;s My Heart is classed as beginner&#39;s but with its two-blocks plus borders, I thought that this on was moving up to an intermediate skill level. Both this, Nine-Patch and Critters use triangles. Chevron is another I thought would be better classed as intermediate. It is probably my favourite quilt in the book, but also seems aimed at a much older teenager, if not adult. Check This, and Let&#39;s Go are two more beginner&#39;s quilts. Call of the Wild is based on strip blocks alternating with squares. Around The Block is also an effective way of using up strips. The instructions are clear, with great photos of the finished quilts and step-by-step line drawings of construction. Great ideas, adaptable designs and lots of fun. * yarnsandfabrics.co.uk *</p><h2>When God &amp; Grief Meet: Comfort and Courage for Your Journey</h2><p><b>Where do you go with the heartache you can&#x2019;t even put into words?</b><br>Whether you have lost a loved one to a prolonged illness or to an unexpected tragedy, it helps to encounter others who have walked a similar road and faced similar questions. <i>When God &amp; Grief Meet</i> offers just that: Real-life stories that meet you in your sorrow and inspire you with the hope and strength to go on.<br><br>Lynn Eib, a longtime patient advocate and grief support group facilitator, shares her gift of encouragement in this heartening message for mourners.

A wealthy English financier living in France, Renauld hints at being in possession of a deadly secret. The Belgian sleuth &#x2014; accompanied by Captain Hastings, his friend from <i>The Mysterious Affair at Styles&nbsp;</i>&#x2014; rushes to answer the call but arrives too late. Stabbed in the back, Poirot's would-be client lies in a shallow grave on the golf course alongside his estate.<br> Renauld's wife, found bound and gagged in her bedroom, identifies a pair of masked intruders as the likeliest culprits. But the thugs prove untraceable even as the roster of suspects expands. The instant dislike formed between Poirot and Monsieur Giraud of the Paris S�ret� further intensifies the investigation, which becomes a competition between their radically different approaches to crime detection. Both are incapable of solving the murder until the discovery of a second corpse, slain in the same manner as the first, provides fresh clues.

He is also the illustrator of the popular Pip and Posy series, and other books with Julia Donaldson including The Ugly Five. Born in Hamburg, Axel now lives with his family in London.The eponymous character introduced by this British team owes a large debt to Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are. When Mouse meets Fox in the "deep dark wood," he invents a story about the gruffalo, described very much like Sendak's fearsome quartet of wild thingsA"He has terrible tusks, and terrible claws, and terrible teeth in his terrible jaws." The gullible fox runs away when Mouse tells him that the gruffalo's favorite food is roasted fox. "Silly old Fox!" says Mouse, "Doesn't he know?/ There's no such thing as a gruffalo!" Owl and Snake follow suit until, with a turn of the page, Mouse runs into the creature he has imagined. Quick-thinking Mouse then tells the monster, "I'm the scariest creature in this deep dark wood./ Just walk behind me and soon you'll see,/ Everyone for miles is afraid of me." Fox, Owl and Snake appear to be terrified of the tiny mouse, but readers can plainly see the real object of their fears. By story's end, the gruffalo flees, and Mouse enjoys his nut lunch in peace. Despite the derivative plot line, debut author Donaldson manipulates the repetitive language and rhymes to good advantage, supplying her story with plenty of scary-but-not-too-scary moments. Scheffler's gruffalo may seem a goofy hybrid of Max's wild things, but his cartoonlike illustrations build suspense via spot-art previews of the monster's orange eyes, black tongue and purple prickles until the monster's appearance in full.

Newcomers to this treatise as well as advanced scholars will learn enormously from the Introduction, extensive notes, and detailed index."<br> &#x2014;Richard Kraut, <i>Northwestern University</i><br><br>"C. D. C. Reeve's study of Aristotle's&nbsp;<i>Politics</i>&nbsp;(translation with introduction, hundreds of notes, and a detailed index of terms) does justice to Aristotle's practical philosophy as a whole in an exceptional way. . . . [Far] from being a simple revision of his previous work (Hackett, 1998) [it] provides us with a totally fresh English text in harmony with his recent translation of the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> (Hackett, 2014). . . . Among the merits of the edition is Reeve's philosophically illuminating Introduction [which] attempts to situate politics within the framework of Aristotelian sciences. . . . It is a great merit of Reeve's Translation and Commentary that his own views are confined to his Introduction. In his sequentially numbered endnotes we most often hear Aristotle's own voice and not a commentary that might have promoted partial interpretations. Apart from the quotation of a wide range of passages from the Aristotelian corpus, the reader will also find clarifications providing her with the assistance necessary to find her own way in the text. . . . In general, comparing the new translation to the Greek text one can hardly fail to recognize that it attains an admirable balance between fidelity and smoothness: though following the syntax of the Greek text, it remains fluent and readable. . . . In a nutshell, Reeve's new translation and commentary is a masterful work.

In this insightful and eloquent book, Sarah Ban Breathnach explores the nine stages necessary to living authentically: Sensing, Surviving, Settling, Stumbling, Selling Out, Starting Over, Searching, Striving, and finally, Something More.</p><p>From the author of <i>Simple Abundance: A Daybook of Comfort and Joy</i> comes a guided excavation for women who suspect that there's something more to life than the top layer pursuits of money, sex, and love. In service to these restless souls who want to scratch beneath the surface, Ban Breathnach offers tidbit-sized essays that help women unearth pay dirt--their reason for being. Using archaeology as her frame of reference, Ban Breathnach suggests imaginative exercises at the end of each chapter, which she refers to as "Field Work." Although it occasionally feels overdone, the archaeology metaphor works well--helping readers unearth their past choices and circumstances to better understand the soul's current mission. Early in the book, Ban Breathnach offers this enticing invitation to go on a spiritual dig: "Besides the fact that your soul is one of the last unlooted sources of the miraculous, with discoveries as spectacular as any found in the Delta of Venus or Egypt's Valley of the Kings, you can embark on a soul trip and be back before anyone even notices you're missing. They might be curious about that gleam in your eye and that flush on your cheek, but I'll never tell if you won't. Are you game? We're heading to the sacred site of your soul." --<i>Gail Hudson</i>You may have a beautiful home, a family you adore, and work that you enjoy. But why do you secretly sense that you need something more to be truly happy? Because it's true. The wisdom, warmth, compassion, and disarming candor of Simple Abundance has made Sarah Ban Breathnach's a trusted voice to millions of women. Now Sarah invites you on a bold, brave, and beautiful continuation of the journey to authenticity, the search for...SOMETHING MORE. <p>In this eloquent and evocative book, Sarah Ban Breathnach encourages you to become an archaeologist of your Self: to plumb your past with its unfulfilled longings, forgotten pleasures, and abandoned dreams, to "excavate" the authentic woman buried inside. </p><p>Uncovering your authentic self will be challenging-but exhilarating. Assisting your personal "dig" will be hints and prompts from the lives of both celebrated and unknown women. These, in tandem with Sarah's own insights, will help you unravel your own mystery and recover the joy that has been missing from your life. Along the way, you will experience small but exquisite epiphanies that will help you come to terms with your past choices and reveal exciting new opportunities that lead to your destiny. </p><p>Dare to begin the journey. Within these pages lie powerful truths that can change your life...and inspire you to settle for nothing less than SOMETHING MORE.</p></p><h2>By Honor Bound: Two Navy SEALs, the Medal of Honor, and a Story of Extraordinary Courage</h2><p><p>In April of 1972, SEAL Lieutenant Tom Norris risked his life in an unprecedented ground rescue of two American airmen who were shot down behind enemy lines in North Vietnam, a feat for which he would be awarded the Medal of Honor--an award that represents the pinnacle of heroism and courage.</p><p>Just six months later, Norris was sent on a dangerous special reconnaissance mission that would take his team deep into enemy territory. On that mission, they engaged a vastly superior force.

SEAL Petty Officer Mike Thornton, under heavy fire, fought his way back onto a North Vietnamese beach to rescue his officer.

Being rich and advantaged doesn&#x2019;t mean you won&#x2019;t be cruelly exposed on paper as a pompous fraud. Conversely, if you write well, being broke and tired won&#x2019;t prevent your talent and mental clarity from shining through. Linda Tirado is just a terrific writer. There&#x2019;s a crucial passage in <i>Hand to Mouth</i> where Linda asks why we all can&#x2019;t at least just agree that someone has to do the grunt work, and that there&#x2019;s dignity in that, too. With this strong and unembarrassed account of her life on the edges of poverty Linda single-handedly re-takes some of the dignity that has been stripped from people without means in this singularly greed-dominated, most mean-spirited generation in America&#x2019;s history. Honesty has its own power and this is a most honest book. Everyone who thinks things are just fine in this country should read it.&#x201d; &#x2014;Matt Taibbi, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author<p><br>"Linda Tirado tells it like it is for tens of millions of America's low-wage workers&#x2014;a group that's growing even as America's billionaires rake in ever more of the nation's total income and wealth. The top hedge-fund partner got $3.5 billion in 2013. That came to $1,750,000 an hour. Yet somehow we can't even raise the minimum wage. Read what Linda has to say and you'll understand it's not because Linda or other low-wage workers somehow deserve to be treated this way any more than the $3.5 billion hedge-fund deserves his pay.

It also leaves you with two inescapable conclusions. First, poverty can happen to anyone&#x2014;even if you are born into the middle class. Second, you can educate people until you are blue in the face, but as long as there are jobs that require sweeping floors, flipping burgers, or waiting tables, we will never eliminate poverty until everyone who works is paid a living wage.&#x201d; &#x2014;Robert Creamer, Democracy Partners, author of <i>Stand Up Straight: How Progressives Can Win</i></p><p></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Hand to Mouth</i> delivers the message to America&#x2019;s poorest citizens, &#x2018;You are not alone,&#x2019; and it represents a wake-up call to the world&#x2019;s wealthiest individuals that income inequality has dangerous economic consequences for real people. It is an insightful, heart-wrenching, and at times laugh-out-loud look into how a third of our fellow Americans are living as poor people in an economy that only serves the top 1%. If you can afford to purchase this book, you will be peering into a world you likely have never known and definitely will never forget.

It is drawn from real life though some names are changed or not given to protect the guilty. The vast majority of ranches in the United States, whether commercial or life style, are neither profitable nor sustainable; the author explains why this is so and what must be done to improve the situation. The changes in philosophy and in management practices required to do this are spelled out in some detail by a man who used them to turn an almost bankrupt ranch into a consistently profitable and stable operation. The book is not a how-to cookbook but rather is an attempt to get people to think of ranching, and agriculture in general, as the biological endeavors, run on sunshine and rainfall that they once were and should be again, rather than the industrial enterprises that are common today. The methods described have been proven effective by people all over the world and their results can be duplicated by anyone who is willing to think through the situation and is not afraid to be different. As the authors&#x2019; father once told him, &#x201c;You have two kinds of neighbors, half of them think you are crazy and the other half knows you are crazy.&#x201d; The management described is not yet universally accepted but it works from all standpoints: it is financially sound, ecologically sound and it is a good way to live and raise a family. Both the new, or would be, rancher just starting out and the established rancher will find information and advice in this book that can be used to make their operation more profitable, less dependent on purchased inputs and markets and a whole lot more fun.</p><p>Walt Davis spent more than fifty years as a working rancher in Texas and Oklahoma. He has lived all of the joys and all of the sorrows that go with ranch life and it is his unbiased opinion that ranching is (depending on how it is done) either the world&#x2019;s best way to make a living or an unending struggle against nature that will break the strongest spirit. Walt grew up in a ranching family and was exposed early on to ranching as it had been practiced in west Texas for many years. After a degree in animal husbandry from Texas A&amp;M College, he took over management of a ranch in southeast Oklahoma. It soon became apparent that there were major flaws in ranch management as he had been taught in college. Walt started searching for &#x201c;a better way.&#x201d; He soon realized that agriculture is a biological rather than an industrial process. This book is an outgrowth of that search and its&#x2019; results. Walt and wife Diann live on a small place on the outskirts of Calera Oklahoma; Walt consults with ranchers and other land managers over a wide area, he teaches seminars, and writes columns for the Farm Progress family of magazines; after a bad fall curtailed his activities, he finalized How to Not Go Broke Ranching and is working on The Gyp Lease Tales and Other Lies (collection of short sketches of ranch life) and The Gathering at Oak Creek, a novel set in the west Texas ranch country.

It explains that IBD is caused by toxic diets and lifestyle stress, and that the body requires a clean-digesting nutritious diet, rest and extra sleep in order to self-heal. This is not a plan for managing IBD and IBS, nor is this a quick-fix gimmick. Rather, this approach removes the causes of disease and promotes lasting health for everyone without medicine by supplying our biological health needs. It is based upon the venerable Natural Hygiene Self-healing System which has led million of people to lasting health. This powerful book covers diet, lifestyle and psychology, presenting the Vegan Diet Healing Plan with correct food combining. This is the only dietary approach which results in a clean bowel, while providing superior nutrition and liberating our full healing powers, for rapid healing and complete rejuvenation.

It teaches the principles of self-healing based in true health science. This complete wholistic wellness guide is the culmination of Dr. Klein s 27 years of health experience since healing himself after 8 years of severe ulcerative colitis in 1984, plus his experience with thousands of clients, 99% of whom successfully healed since 1993 via his Colitis &amp; Crohn's Health Recovery Center. Rooted in the Natural Hygiene self-healthcare system, this guide book contains the clear, step-by-step, medically-endorsed diet &amp; wholistic lifestyle program which has conclusively proved to be the definitive natural way to heal IBD &amp; IBS. Disease only occurs if we cause it. IBD &amp; IBS are completely reversible when we remove the causes &amp; live healthfully. This book served as the author's thesis for his Hygienic Doctor degree. It answers virtually every question which has arisen in over 15,000 consultations. Deep, clearly-written chapters explain the purpose of disease, &amp; how to heal &amp; maintain a lifetime of vibrant health. It accurately explains the many factors and primary cause of inflammatory bowel disease and ulcers: toxic, acidifying, undigestible diets. It presents a naturally liberating dietary healing plan based upon true health science, grounded in physiology. The book explains that inflammation and ulcerations are heightened self-purification / self-healing actions conducted by the body in response to an overload of dietary toxins in the bloodstream, tissues &amp; bowel. It addresses the many factors that may contribute to bowel inflammation &amp; ulcers, &amp; shows how IBD, IBS and any digestive disorder can be permanently overcome via proven dietary and health-promoting lifestyle practices in line with our natural biological mandates. The 100% effective Vegan Diet Healing Plan teaches step-by-step how to eat for rapid healing &amp; long lasting health. It is described in great detail with clear guidelines. It removes the toxic dietary factors which have been proven to cause all forms of IBD, and implements our natural, biologically-correct, most nutritious, purifying, easy-to-digest &amp; healthful diet with a healing &amp; health-promoting program of rest, extra sleep, detoxification, internal cleanliness, emotional release, positive thinking, exercise &amp; other natural lifestyle practices for the restoration &amp; preservation of health. It provides an extensive list of the toxic, indigestible, inflammation-causing foods &amp; other pitfalls to avoid. Countless people have thrived on this Natural Hygiene program for decades. After thousands of clinical cases, the author &amp; several other Medical &amp; Hygienic Doctors have concluded that this natural Hygienic approach is the only true way to heal and keep healthy because it is based on an accurate understanding of human physiology &amp; our biological requisites for health. It involves no medicines, treatments or products; the body is a self-healing organism and it does its healing work perfectly when he provide the conditions for healing. This information saved the author's colon and life in 1984 after suffering with advance ulcerative colitis for 8 years &amp; a colostomy was recommended. Thousands have permanently overcome inflammatory bowel illness by following this plan. The author, a Hygienic Doctor, has personally guided over 2,500 clients to disease-free health. The book was endorsed by 4 medical doctors including 1 gastroenterologist who works with Dr. Klein. This is not a plan for managing IBD and IBS, a quick-fix gimmick that works for only some people, or a program that the author invented based upon unproven theories. Instead, it is based upon factual principles of health science teaching us how to remove the causes of IBD and IBS, fully unleash our self-healing powers &amp; promote lasting wellness.Dr. David Klein has been Director of the Colitis &amp; Crohn s Health Recovery Center, currently located on Maui, Hawaii, since 1993.

As the cardiologist and bestselling author Sandeep Jauhar shows in <i>Heart: A History</i>, it was only recently that we demolished age-old taboos and devised the transformative procedures that have changed the way we live.</p><p>Deftly alternating between key historical episodes and his own work, Jauhar tells the colorful and little-known story of the doctors who risked their careers and the patients who risked their lives to know and heal our most vital organ. He introduces us to Daniel Hale Williams, the African American doctor who performed the world&#x2019;s first open heart surgery in Gilded Age Chicago. We meet C. Walton Lillehei, who connected a patient&#x2019;s circulatory system to a healthy donor&#x2019;s, paving the way for the heart-lung machine. And we encounter Wilson Greatbatch, who saved millions by inventing the pacemaker&#x2015;by accident. Jauhar deftly braids these tales of discovery, hubris, and sorrow with moving accounts of his family&#x2019;s history of heart ailments and the patients he&#x2019;s treated over many years. He also confronts the limits of medical technology, arguing that future progress will depend more on how we choose to live than on the devices we invent. Affecting, engaging, and beautifully written, <i>Heart: A History </i>takes the full measure of the only organ that can move itself.</p></p><p><b>Sandeep Jauhar</b>, MD, PhD, is the director of the Heart Failure Program at Long Island Jewish Medical Center.

Isabelle describes the scene at school with bemused accuracy--the self-important (but really not bad) English teacher, the boy that is constantly fixated on Ashley Barnum, the prettiest girl in class, and the dynamics of the lunchroom, where tables are turf in a all-eyes-open awareness of everybody's relative social position.<br><br>But everything is not normal, really. Since the dealth of her father, Isabelle's family has only functioned on the surface. Her mother, who used to take care of herself, now wears only lumpy, ill-fitting clothes, cries all night, and has taken every picture of her dead husband and put them under her bed. Isabelle tries to make light of this, but the underlying tension is expressed in overeating and then binging. As the novel opens, Isabelle's little sister, April, has told their mother about Isabelle's problem. Isabelle is enrolled in group therapy. Who should show up there, too, but Ashley Barnum, the prettiest, most together girl in class.</p><p>The nuances of adolescent intonation positively roll off Danielle Ferland's tongue in this tale of teen angst. When Isabelle Lee, 13, recently fatherless and currently bulimic, is forced to attend therapy, she befriends the most popular and perfect girl in her school, only to discover that her perfection is a myth. Ferland's strong narration draws the listener into a world made up largely of what is unsaid; the festering silence of Isabelle's father's death adversely affects Isabelle's family as a whole. Isabelle's struggle is fleshed out by Ferland's command of young adult sarcasm and anxiety, which helps make this potentially tragic but ultimately healing story believable.

And her message is consistent--calling people into a personal relationship with God through His Word.&nbsp;</p><br> CHAPTER ONE: Jesus Makes God Visible . . .<br> To Me <i>John 1:1&#x2013;9</i> <br> <b>Y</b>ears ago my mother was invited to a very prestigious dinner party in London, England. The glittering affair included members of the royal family as well as other aristocrats and leaders from British society. The dinner, softened by candlelight, with the tinkle of silver and the sparkle of crystal accompanying the sounds of accented conversation, had an ambiance of elegance. <p>The occasion might have been intimidating for someone unaccustomed to such a setting, but my mother was as at ease as a queen holding court. Dressed in a simple black gown with a triple strand of pearls around her neck, she looked stylish and sophisticated. Heads turned as people whispered their curious inquiries about who she might be. </p><p>But my mother was so interested in the other guests at her table she was oblivious to the small stir she had created. Her expression was not the duly bored, arrogant look adopted by many of the socially elite. Nor were her words stilted and self-conscious. Instead, her eyes danced with the joy of life, and her conversation was lively and peppered with questions as she sought to draw the others at her table into a discussion. </p><p>As she conversed, Mother discovered that the distinguished-looking older gentleman seated beside her was the former head of Scotland Yard, Great Britain&#x2019;s equivalent of the FBI. Fascinated, she respectfully began to probe him for anecdotes. As he opened up under her genuine interest, he revealed that the departments under his authority had included those for forgery and counterfeiting. When she surmised that he must have spent a lot of time studying counterfeit signatures, he corrected her. "On the contrary, Mrs. Graham. I spent all of my time studying the genuine thing. That way, when I saw a counterfeit, I could immediately detect it." </p><p>Today, our world is cluttered with lies, deceit, hypocrisy, and fraud at almost every level. From government leaders to salesclerks &nbsp; to airline ticket agents to restaurant ma�tre d&#x2019;s &nbsp; to business associates to secretaries &nbsp; to friends to neighbors &nbsp; to advertisers, <br> everyone seems to play loose with the truth. </p><p>This "whatever works is right" attitude has even crept into the Christian community. Too often, we focus on methods instead of missions, programs instead of prayer, organization instead of inspiration, pragmatism instead of power. Many preachers preach to be popular, instead of preaching to change lives. Their sermons are 95 percent their own thoughts and 5 percent God&#x2019;s truth. And the average church member <i>cannot tell the difference</i> because he or she is biblically illiterate! </p><p>Sadly, this also tends to twist our perception of Who Jesus is. While some have softened and sentimentalized Him until He is barely recognizable, others have distorted and doubted Him until He is undesirable. </p><p>My mother&#x2019;s dinner partner had unwittingly touched on a very important principle. If you and I want to be able to detect counterfeit Christs and counterfeit truth, we need to immerse ourselves in the real thing. We need to saturate ourselves in the truth of the Word of God. This applies to our faith in general, as well as to our understanding of Jesus. </p><p><i>Who is Jesus? </i>He lived two thousand years ago, in an obscure town, in an obscure country, during a relatively dark period in human history that was dominated by the Roman Empire. Yet He stands unequaled and unparalleled in the phenomenal greatness of His life as well as in the stunning impact He has had on history. </p><p>As we turn the corner into a new millennium and gaze back at the last two thousand years, a handful of individuals seem to rise up from our history pages&#x2014;individuals whose lives or words or accomplishments impacted the entire human race, for good or for bad. Names like Julius Caesar, Martin Luther, Muhammad, Christopher Columbus, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Adolf Hitler, Alexander Graham Bell, Jonas Salk, Joseph Stalin, Mahatma Gandhi, Mao Tse-tung, and David Ben-Gurion come readily to mind. Yet I would heartily agree with Reynolds Price, who in the introduction to his <i>Time</i> magazine cover story on Jesus, wrote, "It would require much exotic calculation . . . to deny that the single most powerful figure&#x2014;not merely in these two millenniums but in all human history&#x2014;has been Jesus of Nazareth." Even today&#x2019;s date is based on the calculation of the date of His birth. </p><p>So <i>Who is Jesus? What is there about Him </i>that makes Him <i>so compelling </i>that . . . . . . a Yugoslavian nun would give her life to comfort the dying in Calcutta for His sake? <br> . . . some of the greatest architectural achievements in Europe were built for worship of Him? <br> . . . some of the world&#x2019;s most beautiful art was created to honor Him? <br> . . . some of the world&#x2019;s most glorious music was written to praise Him? <br> . . . 167 years after Rome crucified Him, He was acknowledged as the only God in the Roman Empire? <br> . . . Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, rotting in a Siberian work camp, said the very thought of Him was enough to keep his sanity? <br> . . . in an outburst of physical pain, frustration, anger, or just disagreement with the officials at a ball game, His Name&#x2014;not Buddha&#x2019;s or Muhammad&#x2019;s&#x2014;is used in cursing? <br> . . . two thousand years after He has been physically removed from the world, people from all walks of life say He has saved them from drugs, illness, suicide, depression, and hopelessness? <br> . . . in His Name, people forsake personal gain to feed the hungry, house the homeless, clothe the naked, heal the sick? Who is Jesus? How can we know who He <i>really</i> is? We know by studying the truth. The only legitimate source of historical information on His life is found in the four New Testament Gospels. This book, <i>Just Give Me Jesus</i>, focuses on the fourth Gospel, written by John, who witnessed firsthand the events he recorded. And John&#x2019;s Gospel is the truth. </p><p>So <i>who is Jesus</i>? Decide the answer for yourself as you read the apostle John&#x2019;s clear, confident, certain, and compelling biography. His stirring account begins by leaving no doubt that Jesus makes God visible to all, because Jesus is God as Man.&nbsp; <br> Jesus is Bigger Than I Think John&#x2019;s Gospel begins with a verbal trumpet flourish: "In the beginning was the Word" (John 1:1). These words immediately take us back to the vastness of eternity before there was anything at all. They also take us back to Genesis, where God began to reveal Himself to all mankind. In Genesis, the Bible itself opens with the exact same phrase, "In the beginning . . . ," as it introduces perhaps the most dramatic chapter of the entire Book.<b> </b>As the passage unfolds the mysteries of creation, the phrase "And God said" is repeated no fewer than ten times in the first chapter.<b> </b>The phrase shows God&#x2019;s awesome creative power as He spoke into existence everything that is or ever has been or ever will be. We might assume that the "word" He spoke, the "word" by which He called everything into being, was a <i>language</i> of some sort with nouns and verbs and pronouns and adverbs conveying His will to empty space. </p><p>Not so! John stuns us in the very first verse of his Gospel, which reveals, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word <i>was</i> God. <i>He</i> was with God in the beginning" (John 1:1&#x2013;2; emphasis added). How awesome that the "Word" that was in the beginning, by which and through which God created everything, was&#x2014;and is&#x2014; a living Person with a mind, will, emotions, and intellect. He Is Eternal The Gospel of John states this living Person was not <i>from</i> the beginning, but that <i>in</i> the beginning of time, space, the universe, eternity, and history, He was already there! He is eternal! </p><p>John&#x2019;s choice of wording in the Greek language makes his opening declaration astounding. His Greek for "Word," which he emphasized by repeating three times in the first verse, is <i>logos</i>, the outward expression of the mind and will that rules the universe. Plato, whose writings were popular in John&#x2019;s day, had said he hoped that someday a "logos" might come forth from God that would make everything about life clear. John, who had perhaps read Plato, began his Gospel by stating in Greek that a "logos" <i>had come </i>from God. And not just a "logos" but the "<i>Living</i> Logos"&#x2014;an outward revelation of the heart and mind of God expressed perfectly for us in a living Person. </p><p>As we meditate on John&#x2019;s words, our sense of awe increases when we realize that "out of the . . . heart, the mouth speaks."<b> </b>So our conclusion is that the Logos who was in the beginning with God is a living Person . . . but He is more. He is the living expression of what is on God&#x2019;s mind. But <i>He is more</i>. He is the living expression of what is on God&#x2019;s heart. But He is even more. He is the very heart of the Almighty God of the universe laid bare for all to see! </p><p>Do you want to know what is on the mind of God? <i>Then look at Jesus! </i>Do you want to know the will of God? Then look at Jesus! Do you want to know what is in the heart of God? Then look at Jesus! Jesus is the exact revelation of what is on the mind and heart and in the will of God! </p><p>Jesus makes God visible. But that truth does not make Him somehow less than God. He is equally supreme with God. He Is Equal Each word John used, including the prepositions, becomes weighty with treasured truth: "He was <i>with</i> God in the beginning." Because you really can&#x2019;t be <i>with</i> yourself, John implies there were two People, two separate supreme Beings Who are equal in power, activity, personality, and intelligence in a face-to-face, eye-to-eye existence. One was not more and One was not less. They were and are equally supreme, sharing the glory and splendor of heaven&#x2019;s throne, because "the Word was <i>God</i>." </p><p>What a wondrous mystery! Our God is one God, yet at the same time He is more than one. Throughout the ages people have engaged in an intellectual wrestling match with this astounding truth. But those who do so miss the blessing that comes from simply worshiping an infinite God Who is beyond our finite understanding. He Is Enduringly the Same As John continued his trumpet flourish, we learn that Jesus, the Living Logos, is enduringly the same today as He always has been: "The same was in the beginning with God" (John 1:2 kjv). There was no personality change in this Person from the beginning of time until John&#x2019;s day to our day to the last day of human history on into eternity. </p><p>The One Who spoke all things into existence and then transformed Planet Earth from a formless, empty, dark, water-submerged blob dangling in space to a beautiful place that reflected His own image is the same Person Who has power today to transform your life and mine. </p><p>The One Who offered all men salvation from the storm of His judgment if they would come into the ark is the same Person today Who offers salvation from His judgment if we would come into Him at the cross. </p><p>The One Who called Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldees, promising to fully bless him if he would follow Him in a life of faith is the same Person Who today calls us out of the world and promises to bless us if we follow Him in a life of faith. </p><p>The One Who delivered His children from bondage to slavery in Egypt with a titanic display of power is the same Person Who was crucified then rose from the dead to deliver His children today from bondage to sin. </p><p>The One Who halted the entire invasion of Canaan by the Israelites while He extended His grace to one Canaanite prostitute is the same Person today Who stops to care for and extend His grace to sinners. </p><p>The One Who elevated David from a shepherd boy to a shepherd king is the same Person today Who places His people in positions of leadership, honor, and authority. </p><p>The One Who answered Elijah&#x2019;s prayer and sent down the fire to consume the sacrifice on Mount Carmel and then sent down the rain to end the three-year drought in Israel is the same Person today Who hears and answers prayer. <i>Do you know Him?</i> If Adam knew Him as a beloved Father, <br> if Eve knew Him as the original Homemaker, <br> if Noah knew Him as the Refuge from the storm, <br> if Abraham knew Him as a Friend, <br> if Moses knew Him as the Redeemer, <br> if Rahab knew Him as the gracious Savior, <br> if David knew Him as his Shepherd, <br> if Elijah knew Him as the Almighty, <br> if Daniel knew Him as the Lion Tamer, <br> if Mary Magdalene knew Him as the Bondage Breaker, <br> if Martha knew Him as the Promise Keeper, <br> if Lazarus knew Him as the Resurrection and the Life, <br> if Bartimaeus knew Him as the Light of the World, <br> if John knew Him as the glorious King upon the throne, <br> <i>Surely you and I can know Him too!</i> The living Person Whom John heard and saw and touched was the same in ages past as He will be in years to come. There is not one God for the Old Testament, another God for the New Testament, another God for today, and still another God for the future. He is the <i>same</i> yesterday, today, and forever.<b> </b>He is enduringly the same! Praise God! You and I <i>can</i> know Him! </p><p>About twenty-five years ago, without a crisis experience but with an unexplainable, intense yearning, I made the decision to seek to know God. Personally. Intimately. Accurately. Experientially. I decided that if each of these Bible characters could know Him then I could too. </p><p>If God hasn&#x2019;t changed, if He is enduringly the same, then if they knew Him and I didn&#x2019;t, the fault must lie with me. So I began a pilgrimage to know God, and that pilgrimage continues to this day. I don&#x2019;t know Him today as well as I want or should, but I know Him better today than I did twenty-five years ago. I know Him better today than I did one year ago. I am growing in my knowledge of God, and I say without hesitation or qualification that knowing God is my joy and reason for living. He is... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Wind beneath my wings, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Treasure that I seek, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the Foundation on which I build, &nbsp; &nbsp; the Song in my heart, &nbsp; the Object of my desire, the Breath of my life&#x2014; <i>He is my All in all!</i> Please join with me in this life-changing <br> discovery as, through the Gospel of John, <br> God just gives us Jesus. Although we may <br> have many preconceived ideas of Who Jesus is, John will show us He is actually bigger than we think and greater than we think.&nbsp; <br> Jesus Is Greater Than I Think The One Who was with God and was God and is the same today as He was in the beginning is the Creator: "Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made" (John 1:3). He Is the Source of Life It can be mind boggling to contemplate the vastness of the universe, from the greatest star to the smallest particle.<b> </b>It is so vast that astronomers are now saying that it stretches beyond what we are capable of penetrating, even with sophisticated telescopes like the Hubble. And every bit of it was created by the Living Word of God, Who, even as He hung the stars in space, counted them and called them each by name! </p><p>Not only did He create objects of massive size, but ...</p></p><h2>Whatever Happened to Worship?: A Call to True Worship</h2><p><p>A.W. Tozer calls God the "Composer of the Cosmos," the "Chief Musician of the Universe." God signals&nbsp;the birds to chirp their beautiful tune in the coolness and tranquility of a spring morning, simply because that is what He designed them to do. Each note is wonderfully constructed by God, uniquely bringing praise to His name. <br><br>With this inspiring perspective on worship, Tozer invites readers to take a deep look at the ways in which we worship and why. He reminds us that we were created solely for this purpose and that worshipping the Father and seeking His fellowship is our primary task. It is also His delight. <br><br>The newest revised edition now includes "Worship: The Missing Jewel of the Evangelical Church," first published in the Alliance Life magazine in 1965, and still so profound today.</p></p><p><b>A.W. TOZER</b> began his lifelong pursuit of God at the age of seventeen after hearing a street preacher in Akron, Ohio. A self-taught theologian, Tozer was a pastor, writer and editor whose powerful use of words continues to grip the intellect and stir the soul of today's reader. Among his best-loved books are the classics <i>The Pursuit of God</i> and <i>The Attributes of God</i>.&#34; The writings of Tozer and this book in particular have had a profound impact on my personal worship, worship leading and worship songwriting.&#34; -- Tommy Walker &#34;Personal Quote for Book&#34;</p><h2>Basic Harp for Beginners</h2><p>A basic, easy-to-understand, step-by-step method about playing the harp. Extensively illustrated, this book is for musicians of all levels, requiring only an interest in learning to play the harp. The material in the book can be applied to any type of harp (with or without pedals) and any type of music. Specific topics covered include basic positioning, tuning, and techniques, etudes, and a colorful selection of folk harp solos. Each section of the book is arranged to show the most efficient way to learn quickly and as easily</p><p>"I didn't know a harp could do that!" is a remark often heard at Laurie Riley's concerts. Known for her ability to make a harp sound like a whole new instrument, she can make it speak, make it laugh and cry. Audiences feel her music as a visceral experience. <p>A professional musician since the age of ten, Laurie has toured throughout the US, in Canada, and in Ireland. She plays selections from around the world, from historical times, as well as compositions of her own. "The richness of various cultures' musical styles offers endless ways to express what I play. Whether it's Celtic, South American, Scandinavian, Israeli, Ukranian... there is something new in each tradition." </p><p>Through her playing, the double-strung harp has emerged as an exciting new sound in the world of harps.

On the surface, her life was great. Nevertheless, she spiraled out, attempted suicide (the first of more attempts to follow), and landed in the ICU and then in a psych ward before setting out to tackle her recovery.<br><br> In <i>Hello I Want to Die Please Fix Me, </i>Mehler Paperny turns her journalist&#x2019;s eye on her own experience and others&#x2019;&#x2014;in the ward; as an outpatient; facing family, friends, and coworkers; finding the right meds; trying to stay insured and employed. She interviews psychiatrists and other experts to reveal how primitive our methods of healing the brain still are&#x2014;and provides an invaluable guide to a system struggling, and often failing, to help those in need. At once heartrending and humorous, outraging and serious, this is essential reading for anyone touched by depression&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s everyone.</p><p><b>Anna Mehler Paperny </b>is a Toronto-based reporter for Reuters.

The book will prove exceptionally useful not only for teachers, practitioners, and coaches, but also for graduate courses in education and in school, child clinical, and counseling psychology."--Russell A. Barkley, PhD, ABPP, ABCN, Department of Psychiatry, Virginia Treatment Center for Children and Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine<br> &nbsp;"If coaching kids with executive skills deficits were a game of football, this book would be the playbook. Dawson and Guare provide both theory and the minute details of how to implement a coaching program. They synthesize cutting-edge research on learning and the brain into an accessible approach. The numerous handouts and clear instructions make the model very easy to start using immediately. As a student of child development and the brain, I strongly recommend this book."--Thomas (Lee) Reynolds, MD, child and adolescent psychiatrist, North Canton, Ohio<br><br> "This book expands on an already-proven model and will be indispensable in my practice of clinical psychotherapy, school-based student support, and educational consultation. Executive skills deficits rarely occur in isolation, and unwinding these ever-building complexities to reengage a frustrated learner is difficult. Now there is a systematic and structured model that will help struggling students benefit from targeted support and develop new pathways for success. This resource represents hope for many children and their parents and teachers."--Benjamin C. Hillyard, MEd, LCMHC, private practice, Exeter, New Hampshire<br><br> "This is a substantial resource for my school psychology practice, where I oversee graduate student interns who serve as coaches in our large, complex high school. This book gives the coaching role needed definition and direction, providing a well-thought-through, evidence-based series of sessions for students with skills deficits in time management, planning and prioritizing, and organization. This model has great benefit to the training needs of the intern/coaches as well. Dawson and Guare present a tidy marriage of coaching and executive skills that includes a complete system for implementation and dissemination."--Suzanne Donnellan, PsyD, Psychologist, Brookline High School (Massachusetts); lecturer, Northeastern University</p><h2>Alex &amp; Me: How a Scientist and a Parrot Discovered a Hidden World of Animal Intelligence--and Formed a Deep Bond in the Process</h2><p><p> "You be good. I love you," were Alex's final words to his owner, research scientist Irene Pepperberg, before his premature death at age thirty-one on September 6, 2007. An African Grey parrot, Alex had a brain the size of a shelled walnut, yet he could add, sound out words, understand concepts like bigger, smaller, more, fewer, and none, and he disproved the widely accepted idea that birds possess no potential for language or anything remotely comparable to human intelligence. <i>Alex &amp; Me</i> is the remarkable true account of an amazing, irascible parrot and his best friend who stayed together through thick and thin for thirty years�the astonishing, moving, and unforgettable story of a landmark scientific achievement and a beautiful relationship. </p></p><p><p>Irene M. Pepperberg is an associate research professor at Brandeis University in Massachusetts and teaches animal cognition at Harvard University. She is head of the Alex Foundation and author of <em>The Alex Studies: Cognitive and Communicative Abilities of Grey Parrots</em>.</p>Alex is the African gray parrot whose ability to master a vocabulary of more than 100 words and answer questions about the color, shape and number of objects&#x2014;garnered wide notice during his life as well as obituaries in worldwide media after his death in September 2007. Pepperberg, who teaches animal cognition, has previously documented the results of her 30-year relationship with Alex in <i>The Alex Studies</i>. While this book inevitably covers some of the same ground, it is a moving tribute that beautifully evokes the struggles, the initial triumphs, the setbacks, the unexpected and often stunning achievements during a groundbreaking scientific endeavor spent uncovering cognitive abilities in Alex that no one believed were possible, and challenging science's deepest assumptions about the origin of human cognitive abilities. Pepperberg deftly interweaves her own personal narrative&#x2014;including her struggles to gain recognition for her research&#x2014;with more intimate scenes of life with Alex than she was able to present in her earlier work, creating a story that scientists and laypeople can equally enjoy, if they can all keep from crying over Alex's untimely death. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

All of the projects use just half a yard of fabric, making them ideal for using up scraps and oddments left over from other projects or sold off cheaply by your favourite fabric store. All you need is a sewing machine and a basic sewing kit, and in no time at all you&#39;ll be making one of the gorgeous projects in the book. There are twenty-six to choose from, including beautiful bags, aprons, a craft caddy for storing your making kit, padded coat hangers, a chicken doorstop, a handy wash bag, a notice board and numerous other gifts and accessories for you, your family and your home. The basic techniques you need to know are explained clearly at the beginning of the book, and every step-by-step project is accompanied by a fabulous photograph of the finished piece, which will not fail to delight and inspire you.</p><p>Debbie Shore started her career as a children&#39;s television presenter and since then has appeared regularly on television both as an actress and selling products on a shopping channel. Debbie has also hosted live fashion shows with a major fashion store, produces her own range of instructional DVDs and writes for several popular sewing magazines. She is now a bestselling author and has written 12 books for Search Press, with several more underway. Debbie was voted Sewing Designer of the Year in the Immediate Media British Craft Awards 2017. She lives in Castle Bytham, Lincs. Visit her website at: debbieshore.co.ukAugust 2014 Many, many months ago I was sent three books of my choice to review from Search Press, and I have finally gotten around to posting a review of the first book: `Half Yard Heaven&#39; by Debbie Shore, which I am told has been one of Search Press&#39;s best sellers of 2014.As its title suggests, the principle of the book is putting to good use leftover scraps of fabric, or, as the author points out, `the fabric could equally as well come from an old tshirt, duvet cover or tablecloth as from a fabric store&#39;. Using up left-over pieces of fabric is a very appealing prospect, as I&#39;m sure it would be to lots of you who also sew and often find yourselves with the odd half metre left over - too pretty to throw away, but too small to use. The visual style of the book is very Cath Kidston inspired - florals, polka dots and stripes abound in pretty pastel colours. The photography is good. Step by step instructions are accompanied by clear photographs, and the layout is well designed and not too fussy or overcrowded. The projects vary in appeal, at least to me! I really liked the Sewing Machine Dust Cover, so I made it, and found it was easy to make, with good, clear, customisable instructions. There are other projects that I could see myself making as gifts for other people. The projects that stand out to me are the slippers, the child&#39;s apron, the owl and the pussycat stuffed toys, the chicken doorstop and the padded coat hanger.

The basic techniques you need to know are explained at the beginning of the book, and every step-by-step project is accompanied by a fabulous photograph of the finished piece, including beautiful bags, aprons, a craft caddy for storing your making kit, a handy wash bag, a notice board and numerous other gifts and accessories for you, your family and your home. * Hot Brands, Cool Places * Dec 13 I don&#39;t know about you, but I have a lot of rather beautiful half yard and fat quarter pieces of fabrics in my stash, so it&#39;s always useful to find a title that focuses on these. This is really a book aimed at beginners or novices, so whilst the projects are very sweet and creative, it may not be challenging enough for some of our more advanced readers. It is however a lovely book of ideas to introduce youngsters to sewing, and it includes a detailed preparation section before it embarks on the 26 projects within. The projects are mainly generally sewing based but some do incorporate basic patchwork, applique and quilting. Large step-by-step instruction photos make it very easy to follow and increase the production values of the book. Favourite projects for me include the chicken doorstop, the oven gloves and the sewing machine dust cover. * Popular Patchwork * Oct 13 As someone who tends to buy fabric in small lengths (fat quarters or half metres) I was very excited when I saw this book was coming out. I&#39;m always on the lookout for projects to make with small amounts of fabric and this book has 26 different projects in it which use either fat quarters or half metres. The projects are a mix between things for your home like a tea cosy, pan holder and peg bag, things to wear such as slippers, children&#39;s apron and rosette head band to useful things like a craft caddy, glasses case, tote bag and table mat. There are big bright photos for every stage of the sewing process, making it easy to follow. There are also step by step written instructions plus useful tips scattered throughout the book. What&#39;s clever is there are no templates in the book, instead Debbie tells you how to create the templates yourself using common household objects like plates or lids. This means no faffing around with photocopiers trying to enlarge templates (yay!). This book is ideal if you have lots of smaller pieces of fabric you want to use up. * Sewing Directory, The * Oct 13 Simple, quick and easy - these projects can be made in a jiffy using small amounts of fabric. Easy to understand instructions and clear photographs show these projects off to advantage. There&#39;s something for everyone and this is a great beginners book. Good range of simple to sew projects for the home and family. Nothing new but a good collection of standby items from aprons and oven gloves to owls and hens, tissue box and sewing machine covers. 26 beautiful projects to make or give as gifts and the book would make a beautiful gift too. * Karen Platt Yarnsandfabrics.co.uk/crafts * May 14 We all have scraps of fabric that we never end up using, so this bestselling book by Debbie Shore for 26 projects to make with less than half a yard of fabric is ideal. There are lots of different ideas in here, some you will have undoubtedly seen before, but lots of other new ones too. They range from tissue box covers, to slippers, glasses cases and placemats. The images, as you would expect, are very clear and bright and the instructions are perfect for sewers of all abilities. Some of my favourite inclusions are for a sewing machine cover, neck cushions (which annoyingly I&#39;d just bought for my girls but will be using the pattern from this once they split) and a gorgeous chicken doorstop - who could resist?! I think that there are lots of useful projects to get your teeth into, and to use up those scraps of left-over fabric! * craftingnotcleaning.blogspot.co.uk * September 2014 If you sew, you probably have a scrap bin full of odd-sized pieces of fabric that you don&#39;t know what to do with. Avid sewist Shore provides 26 small projects designed to use these small-to-medium scraps. Despite the book&#39;s title, a half yard isn&#39;t needed for most of the projects, which focus on cute, feminine accessories for women and girls. Highlights include the craft caddy, with numerous pockets to hold various bits and bobs of crafty stuff (and a convenient handle for portablility), a zippered makeup bag, and an easily customizable pair of house slippers with soft fleece soles. The projects are easy to sew and require basic sewing machine skills (straight and zigzag stitch, topstitching, and zipper installation), and key steps are illustrated with photographs. VERDICT This pretty collection will appeal to sewists looking for simple, quick projects to make as gifts. * Fibre Crafts *</p><h2>Girls Made of Snow and Glass</h2><p><p><b>Melissa Bashardoust&#x2019;s acclaimed debut novel <i>Girls Made of Snow and Glass </i>is &#x201c;Snow White as it&#x2019;s never been told before...a feminist fantasy fairy tale not to be missed&#x201d; (<i>BookPage</i>)!</b></p><p>&#x201c;Utterly superb.&#x201d; &#x2015;ALA <i>Booklist</i>, <b>starred review</b><br>&#x201c;Dark, fantastical, hauntingly evocative.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, <b>starred review</b><br>&#x201c;An empowering and progressive original retelling.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>SLJ</i>, <b>starred review</b><br><b></b><br>Sixteen-year-old Mina is motherless, her magician father is vicious, and her silent heart has never beat with love for anyone&#x2015;has never beat at all, in fact, but she&#x2019;d always thought that fact normal.

Summers and Barber debunk outdated and stereotyped ideas about dynamic psychotherapy by describing in a clear, pragmatic manner the core principles and the unique aspects of a dynamic approach.

The company Facundo Bacardi launched in Cuba in 1862 brought worldwide fame to the island, and in the decades that followed his Bacardi descendants participated in every aspect of Cuban life. With his intimate account of their struggles and adventures across five generations, Gjelten brings to life the larger story of Cuba&#39;s fight for freedom, its tortured relationship with America, the rise of Fidel Castro, and the violent division of the Cuban nation.</p><p>Tom Gjelten is a veteran correspondent for National Public Radio on international issues and a regular panelist on the PBS program <i>Washington Week</i>. His reporting from Bosnia won him George Polk and Robert F. Kennedy awards. He is the author of <i>Sarajevo Daily: A City and Its Newspaper Under Siege</i>. He lives in Arlington, Virginia, with his family.The commonplace view of Cuba's prerevolutionary business establishment as a corrupt kleptocracy is revised in this intriguing history of the Bacardi rum company and its involvement in Cuban politics. NPR correspondent Gjelten (<i>Sarajevo Daily</i>) paints the 146-year-old distiller, once an icon of Cuban industry, as a model corporate citizen&#x2014;efficient, innovative, socially responsible and union-tolerant. Its leaders were pillars of nationalist politics, he contends: company president Emilio Bacardi was a leader of Cuba's rebellion against Spain, and in the 1950s CEO Jos� Bosch helped fund Castro's insurrection. (After Castro nationalized Bacardi's Cuban holdings, Bosch started funding anti-Castro exiles.) Bacardi's image as Cuban-nationalism-in-a-bottle becomes farcical when the company, now a multinational behemoth, fights an absurd court battle with Cuba's state rum company over the Havana Club trademark. But Gjelten's account of a liberal, progressive Cuban business clan complicates and enriches the conventional picture of a society torn between right and left dictatorships. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is primarily an instruction manual for the serious spiritual devotee, and reveals information only known by those who have transcended the ego to reach Divine Realization. This is the inner route from the self to the Self. The subjective states of the mystic are of great interest, but historically never have been clarified to the degree presented in this semi-autobiographical account that also provides the means by which to identify their rare occurrence, and thus describe the core characteristics of Spiritual Truth. Devoid of ecclesiastical doctrine or religious belief systems, the pristine essence of all spiritual Truth is revealed in its purity with unprecedented clarity.</p><p>The subjective state of the Enlightened Mystic or Sage has been described in different cultures in different centureis, but it is always essentially the same. The substrate out of which arises all awareness or consciousness shines forth when inumpeded by the limited linear ego and its ordinary mind. In the Transcendent state, the Divinity of all Creation shines forth, and mind is replaced by Mind in its Infinite Glory. This work will appeal to those who themselves are dedicated to the spiritual Reality of Truth as the direct pathway to God. The devotion to Truth is itself transformative. It is the author&#39;s intention that this work contribute to the reader&#39;s transcendence of the ego to reach the state of Enlightenment.David R.

Scotti tells the story. <br>This spellbinding narrative, focusing on the extraordinary human drama that unfolded as an unlikely alignment of meteorological conditions conspired to bring a deadly tropical cyclone to the Northeast in the summer of 1938, summons back the most ferocious storm ever to hit the East Coast. It was a natural disaster so intense that it indelibly marked not only the lives of families across seven states but also the land itself, requiring the entire coastline map of New England to be redrawn</p><p>R. A. Scotti, a former journalist at the Providence Journal, is the author of numerous thrillers and novels of international espionage. She lives in New York City. This is her second work of nonfiction.Former journalist and mystery novelist Scotti successfully applies her skills in both genres to this detailed retelling of the 1938 hurricane that ripped across seven Northeastern states and killed 682 people, "the most destructive natural disaster in U.S. history-worse than the San Francisco earthquake, the Chicago fire, or any Mississippi flood." Although the enormity of the destruction has been written about before, Scotti focuses on "a few experiences that seem representative of many more" through interviews with hurricane survivors, their families and friends, as well as previously published recollections by survivors, including the late Katharine Hepburn. Scotti's detailed look at the general extent of the hurricane's destruction adds poignancy to individual stories, such as those of Joseph Matoes, who sees his children swept away from their school bus as they are battered by huge waves; Lillian Tetlow and Jack Kinney, two sweethearts who survive a storm that destroys Napatree, R.I., and who later marry; and Charles Pierce, a "green and unsure" junior forecaster for a woefully underprepared U.S. Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service) who stands against his experienced superiors as the only forecaster to recognize the danger of the hurricane. Scotti also skillfully presents the details of a hurricane, although she reminds us that "after decades of study and with all the technological tools of the trade... we still cannot predict a hurricane more than twenty-four hours in advance." <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Remote Places to Stay</h2><p>Discover magical, remote locations around the world, from Africa to the Arctic, that will help you disconnect from modern life and enter a state of wonder.<br><br>Silence.

The battleground of Satan&#39;s attack has been in the mental arena. Yet there has not been any practical teaching that would guide people into mental and emotional wholeness. This book will show you how to reverse the emotional curse and, in so doing, open the door for physical healing and miracles in believers&#39; lives. Doctors cannot reverse the curse of sickness. Only Jesus can reverse the curse and bring perfect healing and wholeness to an individual&#39;s life.

Books containing these three words are typically fluff or incomprehensible; this one is not. &#34;Q is for Quantum&#34; teaches a theory at the forefront of modern physics to an audience presumed to already know only basic arithmetic. Topics covered range from the practical (new technologies we can expect soon) to the foundational (old ideas that attempt to make sense of the theory). The theory is built up precisely and quantitatively. Deceptively vague jargon and analogies are avoided, and mysterious features of the theory are made explicit and not skirted. The tenacious reader will emerge with a better technical understanding of why we are troubled by this theory than that possessed by many professional physicists.</p><p></p><h2>One Goal: A Coach, a Team, and the Game That Brought a Divided Town Together</h2><p><strong>In the tradition of <i>Friday Night Lights</i> and <i>Outcasts United</i>, ONE GOAL tells the inspiring story of the soccer team in a town bristling with racial tension that united Somali refugees and multi-generation Mainers in their quest for state--and ultimately national--glory.</strong><br><br>When thousands of Somali refugees resettled in Lewiston, Maine, a struggling, overwhelmingly white town, longtime residents grew uneasy. Then the mayor wrote a letter asking Somalis to stop coming, which became a national story. While scandal threatened to subsume the town, its high school's soccer coach integrated Somali kids onto his team, and their passion began to heal old wounds. Taking readers behind the tumult of this controversial team--and onto the pitch where the teammates vied to become state champions and achieved a vital sense of understanding--ONE GOAL is a timely story about overcoming the prejudices that divide us.</p><p>A professor of history in New York, <b>Amy Bass</b> lived in Lewiston, Maine for four years as a student at Bates College.

The approach is based on an elegant principle of cognitive apprenticeship: meet students at their current state of being with their current interests and use this as the platform to help them outgrow themselves. The approach allows for authentic and democratic differentiation &#x2013; through various materials, levels of support, groupings &#x2013; while all students are working in complementary ways on a common project. This approach mirrors what expert adult readers do: they put texts into conversation with each other to make global meanings." Author: Jeffrey D. Wilhelm, Professor of English Education<br><br>"Berit Gordon is the best word whisperer, lighting a love for words in even the most reluctant of readers and writers. Her techniques created an atmosphere of electricity in a classroom that had lost its spark for communication. Many books that I&#x2032;ve read only speak to the strategy and provide anchor charts. Berit goes further and explains the what, why, how, and when of the strategy in use. This is key. Berit is key. For many of us, we know what we want our students to do. We just need a little direction to get there. Berit provides the map, serves as GPS, and leads us to the place where our classrooms are now abuzz with engaged readers and inspired writers." Author: Wendy Platt<br><br>"While I had spent over 20 years implementing book clubs and independent reading in my Language Arts classroom, I had never quite approached it in the same way Berit Gordon outlined in No More Fake Reading. &nbsp; Now, my students are reading at least double the previous required amount, and they are thrilled with the large amount of choice. &nbsp;I found it effortless to create a curriculum where I match in-class texts with independent reading. &nbsp;The students find the more challenging texts enjoyable when sampling them rather than haranguing through the truly difficult ones or just reading spark notes!"<br> &nbsp; Author: Rose Leonard, English Teacher<br><br>"After attending an eye-opening workshop with Berit Gordon, I followed her lead and tried something new with my Freshmen College Prep Students. &nbsp;I&#x2019;d been teaching Great Expectations to this age group for years and it was always a challenge for them and for me. &nbsp;The assigned nightly reading went unread, and if they did read, they did not understand it. &nbsp;Every day felt exhausting, as I would re-teach the previous night&#x2019;s assignment. &nbsp;This year, using Berit&#x2019;s ideas as a guide, I opted to use the novel as an in-class text, analyzing passages to teach close reading skills while the students chose books to read on their own ... Students delved into these high interest, contemporary books and made consistent, meaningful connections between Great Expectations and their independent novels. &nbsp;They wrote literary essays about their choice books, and took a test on Great Expectations, for which they received extremely high marks, demonstrating their mastery of a sophisticated (and previously dreaded!) text. &nbsp;The experiment was a huge success! &nbsp;Working through a complex text together with focused instruction enabled students to engage with a difficult book, and appreciate it in a way they never had before. &nbsp;Interestingly, they enjoyed Dickens so much that I taught more of the book than I had originally planned!"<br> Author: Ellin Glassband, High School Teacher<br><br>"How can we inspire reading and critical thinking in a time of widespread student distraction and disengagement?

I didn&#x2019;t want to rant. I&#x2019;d mounted my Sony camcorder on a tripod and rotated the LCD screen in order to see myself as I spoke. I&#x2019;d lost weight over the past weeks. My eyes were red with fatigue, the orbits shiny and dark. I looked more like a hunted criminal than a grieving friend.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really know where to begin. I keep seeing Andrew lying on the floor. And I know they killed him. But...I&#x2019;m getting ahead of myself. You need facts. I was born in 1961 in Los Alamos, New Mexico. My father was James Howard Tennant, the nuclear physicist. My mother was Ann Tennant, a pediatrician. I&#x2019;m making this tape in a sober state of mind, and I&#x2019;m going to deposit it with my attorney as soon as I finish, on the understanding that it should be opened if I die for any reason.<br><br>&#x201c;Six hours ago, my colleague Dr. Andrew Fielding was found dead beside his desk, the victim of an apparent stroke. I can&#x2019;t prove it, but I know Fielding was murdered. For the past two years, he and I have been part of a scientific team funded by the National Security Agency and DARPA&#x2014;the government agency that created the Internet in the 1970s. Under the highest security classification, that team and its work are known as Project Trinity.&#x201d;<br><br>I glanced down at the short-barreled Smith &amp; Wesson .38 in my lap. I&#x2019;d made sure the pistol wasn&#x2019;t visible on camera, but it calmed me to have it within reach. Reassured, I again stared at the glowing red light.<br><br>&#x201c;Two years ago, Peter Godin, founder of the Godin Supercomputing Corporation, had an epiphany much like that mythical moment when an apple dropped onto Isaac Newton&#x2019;s head. It happened in a dream. Seemingly from nowhere, a seventy-year-old man visualized the most revolutionary possibility in the history of science. When he woke up, Godin telephoned John Skow, a deputy director of the NSA, in Fort Meade, Maryland. By six A.M., the two men had drafted and delivered a letter to the president of the United States. That letter shook the White House to its foundations. I know this because the president was my brother&#x2019;s close friend in college. My brother died three years ago, but because of him, the president knew of my work, which is what put me in the middle of all that followed.&#x201d;<br><br>I rubbed the cool metal of the .38, wondering what to tell and what to leave out. Leave out nothing, said a voice in my head. My father&#x2019;s voice. Fifty years ago, he&#x2019;d played his own part in America&#x2019;s secret history, and that burden had greatly shortened his days. My father died in 1988, a haunted man, certain that the Cold War he&#x2019;d spent his youthful energy to perpetuate would end with the destruction of civilization, as it so easily could have. Leave out nothing....<br><br>&#x201c;The Godin Memo,&#x201d; I continued, &#x201c;had the same effect as the letter Albert Einstein sent President Roosevelt at the beginning of World War Two, outlining the potential for an atomic bomb and the possibility that Nazi Germany might develop one. Einstein&#x2019;s letter spurred the Manhattan Project, the secret quest to ensure that America would be the first to possess nuclear weapons. Peter Godin&#x2019;s letter resulted in a project of similar scope but infinitely greater ambition. Project Trinity began behind the walls of an NSA front corporation in the Research Triangle Park of North Carolina. Only six people on the planet ever had full knowledge of Trinity. Now that Andrew Fielding is dead, only five remain. I&#x2019;m one. The other four are Peter Godin, John Skow, Ravi Nara&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>I bolted to my feet with the .38 in my hand. Someone was rapping on my front door. Through thin curtains, I saw a Federal Express truck parked at the foot of my sidewalk. What I couldn&#x2019;t see was the space immediately in front of my door.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; I called.<br><br>&#x201c;FedEx,&#x201d; barked a muffled male voice. &#x201c;I need a signature.&#x201d;<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t expecting a delivery. &#x201c;Is it a letter or a package?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Letter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who from?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uhh...Lewis Carroll.&#x201d;<br><br>I shivered. A package from a dead man? Only one person would send me a package under the name of the author of Alice in Wonderland. Andrew Fielding. Had he sent me something the day before he died? Fielding had been obsessively searching the Trinity labs for weeks now, the computers as well as the physical space. Perhaps he&#x2019;d found something. And perhaps whatever it was had got him killed. I&#x2019;d sensed something strange about Fielding&#x2019;s behavior yesterday&#x2014;not so easy with a man famed for his eccentricities&#x2014;but by this morning he&#x2019;d seemed to be his old self.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you want this thing or not?&#x201d; asked the deliveryman.<br><br>I cocked the pistol and edged over to the door. I&#x2019;d fastened the chain latch when I&#x2019;d got home. With my left hand, I unlocked the door and pulled it open to the length of the chain. Through the crack, I saw the face of a uniformed man in his twenties, his hair bound into a short ponytail.<br><br>&#x201c;Pass your pad through with the package. I&#x2019;ll sign and give it back to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a digital pad. I can&#x2019;t give you that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Keep your hand on it, then.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Paranoid,&#x201d; he muttered, but he stuck a thick orange pad through the crack in the door.<br><br>I grabbed the stylus hanging from the string and scrawled my name on the touch-sensitive screen. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br>The pad disappeared, and a FedEx envelope was thrust through. I took it and tossed it onto the sofa, then shut the door and waited until I heard the truck rumble away from the curb.<br><br>I picked up the envelope and glanced at the label. &#x201c;Lewis Carroll&#x201d; had been signed in Fielding&#x2019;s spidery hand. As I pulled the sheet of paper from the envelope, a greasy white granular substance spilled over my fingers. The instant my eyes registered the color, some part of my brain whispered anthrax. The odds of that were low, but my best friend had just died under suspicious circumstances. A certain amount of paranoia was justified.<br><br>I hurried to the kitchen and scrubbed my hands with dish soap and water. Then I pulled a black medical bag from my closet. Inside was the usual pharmacopoeia of the M.D.&#x2019;s home: analgesics, antibiotics, emetics, steroid cream. I found what I wanted in a snap compartment: a blister pack of Cipro, a powerful broad-spectrum antibiotic. I swallowed one pill with water from the tap, then took a pair of surgical gloves from the bag. As a last precaution, I tied a dirty T-shirt from the hamper around my nose and mouth. Then I folded the FedEx envelope and letter into separate Ziploc bags, sealed them, and laid them on the counter.<br><br>As badly as I wanted to read the letter, part of me resisted. Fielding might have been murdered for what was written on that page. Even if that weren&#x2019;t the case, nothing good would come from my reading it.<br><br>I carefully vacuumed the white granules from the carpet in the front room, wondering if I could be wrong about Fielding&#x2019;s death being murder. He and I had worked ourselves into quite a state of suspicion over the past weeks, but then we had reason to. And the timing was too damn convenient. Instead of putting the vacuum cleaner back into the closet, I walked to the back door and tossed the machine far into the yard. I could always buy another one.<br><br>I was still eerily aware of the letter sitting on the kitchen counter. I felt like a soldier&#x2019;s wife refusing to open a telegram. But I already knew my friend was dead. So what did I fear?<br><br>The why, answered a voice in my head. Fielding talking. You want to keep your head in the sand. It&#x2019;s the American national pastime....<br><br>More than a little irritated to find that the dead could be as bothersome as the living, I picked up the Ziploc containing the letter and carried it to the front room. The note was brief and handwritten.<br><br>David,<br><br>We must meet again. I finally confronted Godin with my suspicions. His reaction astounded me. I don&#x2019;t want to commit anything to paper, but I know I&#x2019;m right. Lu Li and I are driving to the blue place on Saturday night. Please join us. It&#x2019;s close quarters, but discreet. It may be time for you to contact your late brother&#x2019;s friend again, though I wonder if even he can do anything at this point. Things like this have a momentum greater than individuals. Greater even than humanity, I fear. If anything should happen to me, don&#x2019;t forget that little gold item I asked you to hold for me one day. Desperate times, mate. I&#x2019;ll see you Saturday.<br><br>There was no signature, but below the note was a hand-drawn cartoon of a rabbit&#x2019;s head and the face of a clock. The White Rabbit, an affectionate nickname given Fielding by his Cambridge physics students. Fielding always carried a gold pocket watch, and that was the &#x201c;little gold item&#x201d; that he had asked me to hold for him one day.<br><br>We were passing each other in the hallway when he pressed the watch and chain into my hand. &#x201c;Mind keeping that for an hour, old man?&#x201d; he&#x2019;d murmured. &#x201c;Lovely.&#x201d; Then he was gone. An hour later he stopped by my office to pick it up, saying he hadn&#x2019;t wanted to take the watch into the MRI lab with him, where it could have been smashed against the MRI unit by the machine&#x2019;s enormous magnetic fields. But Fielding visited the MRI lab all the time, and he&#x2019;d never given me his pocket watch before. And he never did again. It must have been in his pocket when he died. So what the hell was he up to that day?<br><br>I read the note again. Lu Li and I are driving to the blue place on Saturday night. Lu Li was Fielding&#x2019;s new Chinese wife. The &#x201c;blue place&#x201d; had to be code for a beach cabin at Nags Head, on North Carolina&#x2019;s Outer Banks. Three months ago, when Fielding asked for a recommendation for his honeymoon, I&#x2019;d suggested the Nags Head cabin, which was only a few hours away. Fielding and his wife had loved the place, and the Englishman had apparently thought of it when he wanted a secure location to discuss his fears.<br><br>My hands were shaking. The man who had written this note was now as cold as the morgue table he was lying on, if indeed he was lying in a morgue. No one had been able&#x2014;or willing&#x2014;to tell me where my friend&#x2019;s body would be taken. And now the white powder. Would Fielding have put powder in the envelope and neglected to mention it in his letter? If he didn&#x2019;t, who did? Who but the person who had murdered him?<br><br>I laid the letter on the sofa, stripped off the surgical gloves, and rewound the videotape to the point at which I&#x2019;d walked out of the frame. I had decided to make this tape because I feared I might be killed before I could tell the president what I knew. Fielding&#x2019;s letter had changed nothing. Yet as I stared into the lens, my mind wandered. I was way ahead of Fielding on calling my &#x201c;late brother&#x2019;s friend.&#x201d; The moment I&#x2019;d seen Fielding&#x2019;s corpse on the floor of his office, I knew I had to call the president. But the president was in China. Still, as soon as I got clear of the Trinity lab, I&#x2019;d called the White House from a pay phone in a Shoney&#x2019;s restaurant, a &#x201c;safe&#x201d; phone Fielding had told me about. It couldn&#x2019;t be seen by surveillance teams in cars, and the restaurant&#x2019;s interior geometry made it difficult for a parabolic microphone to eavesdrop from a distance.<br><br>When I said &#x201c;Project Trinity,&#x201d; the White House operator put me through to a man who gruffly asked me to state my business. I asked to speak to Ewan McCaskell, the president&#x2019;s chief of staff, whom I&#x2019;d met during my visit to the Oval Office. McCaskell was in China with the president. I asked that the president be informed that David Tennant needed to speak to him urgently about Project Trinity, and that no one else involved with Trinity should be informed. The man said my message would be passed on and hung up.<br><br>Thirteen hours separated North Carolina and Beijing. That made it tomorrow in China. Daylight. Yet four hours had passed since my call, and I&#x2019;d heard nothing. Would my message be relayed to China, given the critical nature of the summit? There was no way to know. I did know that if someone at Trinity heard about my call first, I might wind up as dead as Fielding before I talked to the president.<br><br>I hit START on the remote control and spoke again to the camera.<br><br>&#x201c;In the past six months I&#x2019;ve gone from feeling like part of a noble scientific effort to questioning whether I&#x2019;m even living in the United States. I&#x2019;ve watched Nobel laureates give up all principle in a search for&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>I went still. Something had passed by one of my front windows. A face. Very close, peering inside. I&#x2019;d seen it through the sheer curtains, but I was sure. A face, framed by shoulder-length hair. I had a sense of a woman&#x2019;s features, but...<br><br>I started to get up, then sat back down. My teeth were vibrating with an electric pain like aluminum foil crushed between dental fillings. My eyelids felt too heavy to hold open. Not now, I thought, shoving my hand into my pocket for my prescription bottle. Jesus, not now. For six months, every member of Trinity&#x2019;s inner circle had suffered frightening neurological symptoms. No one&#x2019;s symptoms were the same. My affliction was narcolepsy. Narcolepsy and dreams. At home, I usually gave in to the trancelike sleep. But when I needed to fight off a spell&#x2014;at Trinity, or driving my car&#x2014;only amphetamines could stop the overwhelming waves.<br><br>I pulled out my prescription bottle and shook it. Empty. I&#x2019;d swallowed my last pill yesterday. I got my speed from Ravi Nara, Trinity&#x2019;s neurologist, but Nara and I were no longer speaking. I tried to rise, thinking I&#x2019;d call a pharmacy and prescribe my own, but that was ridiculous. I couldn&#x2019;t even stand. A leaden heaviness had settled into my limbs. My face felt hot, and my eyelids began to fall.<br><br>The prowler was at the window again. In my mind, I raised my gun and aimed it, but then I saw the weapon lying in my lap. Not even survival instinct could clear the fog filling my brain. I looked back at the window. The face was gone. A woman&#x2019;s face. I was sure of it. Would they use a woman to kill me? Of course. They were pragmatists. They used what worked.<br><br>Something scratched at my doorknob. Through the thickening haze I fought to aim my gun at the door. Something slammed against the wood. I got my finger on the trigger, but as my swimming brain transmitted the instruction to depress it, sleep annihilated consciousness like fingers snuffing a candle flame.<br><br>Andrew Fielding sat alone at his desk, furiously smoking a cigarette. His hands were shaking from a confrontation with Godin. It had happened the previous day, but Fielding had the habit of replaying such scenes in his mind, agonizing over how ineffectually he had stated his case, murmuring retorts he should have made at the time but had not.<br><br>The argument had been the result of weeks of frustration. Fielding didn&#x2019;t like arguments, not ones outside the realm of physics, anyway. He&#x2019;d put off the meeting until the last possible moment. He pottered around his office, pondering one of the central riddles of quantum physics: how two particles fired simultaneously from the same source could arrive at the same destination at the same instant, even though one had to travel ten times as far as the other. It was like two 747s flying from New York to Los Angeles&#x2014;one flying direct and the other having to fly south to Miami before turning west to Los Angeles&#x2014;yet both touching down at LAX at the same moment. The 747 on the direct route flew at the speed of light, yet the plane that had to detour over Miami still reached L.A. at the same instant. Which meant that the second plane had flown faster than the speed of light. ...</p><h2>Preparing for Kreutzer: Volume 1 (Rubank Educational Library)</h2><p>(String Method).

The book brings together the latest in neuroscience research to present a new and proven approach to brain health and aging.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<p><b>&#x201c;The most important book you&#x2019;ll read this year.&#x201d;</b></p> The Neurogenesis Diet and Lifestyle brings together the latest in neuroscience research to present a new and proven view of brain health and aging. <br><br> Only recently has it been discovered that the brain produces new brain cells throughout our entire lives, a process called neurogenesis. <b>The rate at which we form new brain cells has a profound influence upon every aspect of our life</b>. When the rate of neurogenesis is low, we see cognitive deficits and memory problems, anxiety and stress, depression, and lowered immunity. Life is difficult. <br><br> With high rates of neurogenesis we see the opposite: <b>enhanced cognitive abilities, rapid learning, emotional resilience, protection from anxiety, stress and depression, heightened immunity and robust health</b>. We flourish. Life is wonderful. <br><br> Given the neurotoxic norms of society, it&#x2019;s almost universally true that your brain is working <b>far below its capacity</b>. It is deteriorating much faster than it needs to. What good is living longer if your brain can&#x2019;t go the distance? <br><br> Recent discoveries in the emerging field of neurogenesis reveal the secrets to radically improve your brain&#x2019;s health. You can operate at a higher level than you ever dreamed possible &#x2013; at any age! <br><br> <p><b>"A revolutionary paradigm shift in brain health and brain aging."</b></p> This scientifically validated, 4-point program of diet and lifestyle will: � Improve your <b>memory</b> and <b>brain power </b> � Inoculate you against <b>stress</b> and <b>depression</b> � Prevent or delay cognitive decline, dementia and <b>Alzheimer&#x2019;s</b> � Enrich your relationships and <b>sex life </b> � Help you connect with your loving center of <b>peace </b> <br><br> This book presents the latest neuroscience discoveries to increase brain power, enhance memory, increase brain fitness by seeing what kinds of brain exercises actually work, and build a better brain. It contains dietary recommendations for brain food, brain vitamins, brain supplements, memory vitamins and memory supplements. <br><br> <p><b>&#x201c;This is the best book to give anyone over 50!&#x201d;</b></p> This book also spells out the symptoms of dementia, the stages of dementia, signs of cognitive decline and stages of Alzheimer&#x2019;s. The plan presented in The Neurogenesis Diet and Lifestyle will help to ward off cognitive decline and avoid dementia stages. This lifestyle is the only lifestyle for which there is scientific evidence supporting it, based on a late 2014 research study by the Buck Foundation. <br><br> The Neurogenesis Diet and Lifestyle is aimed at improving how your brain functions. Your rate of neurogenesis may be the most important factor in your brain health. And increasing your rate of neurogenesis by three to five times can result in powerfully improved memory, learning, cognitive enhancement, as well as improved immunity and protection against stress and depression. <br><br> <b>You can live and perform well beyond where you are now.</b> <br><br> For more information, please visit: <p><b>NeurogenesisDiet.com</b></p> <br><br> <i>Tags: health, fitness, diet, happiness, mental health, neuroscience</i></p><p>Brant Cortright, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist and Professor of Psychology at California Institute of Integral Studies.

And here it is. Written in a clear, convincing and energetic manner by seasoned researcher, clinician and life-long educator Brant Cortright, Ph.D., the groundbreaking Neurogenesis Diet and Lifestyle presents an indispensable set of scientifically grounded skills and strategies which lead to optimal brain health at any age and stage in life. <br> <br>In his truly holistic, original concept of &#x201c;neurohealthy life&#x201d;, Prof. Cortright teaches us how different modalities of life engage the central biological mechanism of neurogenesis, which underlies subjective well-being.

As a guide to retraining, attuning, enhancing and vivifying the brain and a manifesto of holistic health, this book will be of interest not only to the general public, psychologists, psychiatrists, and neuroscientists, but to everybody interested in the practical aspects of the mind-body problem.&#x201d; -- <b><i>Olga Louchakova-Schwartz, M.D., Ph.D., Neuroscientist, Professor and Director of Research, Sofia University</i></b></p><h2>Our Lady&#39;s Message of Mercy to the World</h2><p>My dear little one, I smile on you even though you think you are wounded beyond repair, no one is beyond repair only those that wish to stay that way! &#34;When you hold the book, you hold Me, your Mediatrix of all Grace.

Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. The Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, also called the Rosicrucian Order (AMORC), is a worldwide philosophical and humanistic, fraternal order devoted to &#34;the study of the elusive mysteries of life and the universe.&#34; The organization is non-sectarian and it is open to both men and women of adult age regardless of their various religious persuasions. The current open cycle in America of AMORC was re-activated by Harvey Spencer Lewis in 1915. Lewis received authority to do so from the Supreme Council of the Rosicrucian Order after being tried, tested and finally initiated into the Order in 1909, Toulouse, France. AMORC&#39;s teachings draw upon ideas of the major philosophers, particularly Pythagoras, Thales, Solon, Heraclitus and Democritus. The teachings are divided into Degrees which are further grouped into broad categories under titles such as Postulant, Neophyte and Initiate sections. These degrees cover various fields related to physical, mental, psychic and spiritual existence such as physics, metaphysics, biology, psychology, parapsychology, comparative religion, traditional healing techniques, health, intuition, extrasensory perception, material and spiritual alchemy, meditation, sacred architecture, symbolism, and that mystical state of consciousness relating to the experience of unity with the Divine.

The Phoenix Grievers, ordinary people whose attributes enable them to transform and transcend their own grief, are used as models of the self-actualization that can result in the aftermath of an unbearable loss. Based on the experiences of these exceptional grievers, bereavement therapist Joanne Jozefowski offers guidelines on how to avoid hazards, adapt with healthy coping mechanisms, and eliminate unnecessary suffering. She provides a developmental model of the process of grief; identifies the phases of impact, chaos, adaptation, equilibrium and transformation; and offers phase-specific recommendations for the bereaved and their therapists. <br><br>A well-written and valuable resource for both grievers and the mental health professionals who help them, this book provides hope for transformational grief and the tools to forge that outcome.</p><p><b>Joanne T.

She is the founder of Counseling Affiliates, a group practice focusing on issues of loss and grief, and is an adjunct doctoral faculty member of The Union Institute, Cincinnati, OhioThis book offers us a highly compelling and credible account of the human capacity to grow from the adversity of grief. It maps a sophisticated journey that can lead us from our most searing losses into unusual strength of character and conviction previously unknown to us. Both poignant and practical, this clearly written book provides solid, compassionate company for grievers and helpers alike. (Gina O'Connell Higgins, Ed.D, author, Resilient Adults: Overcoming a Cruel Past)<br><br>This book is like feeling the steady hand of a warm, compassionate friend who will walk with you through every step&#x2015;all the way from surviving the agony of your loss, helping you cope, recovering, and eventually finding new meaning and purpose in your life. (Al Siebert Ph.D., author of The Survivor Personality)<br><br>In recent years, there has been a change from understanding the ways that individuals cope with grief to seeing the ways that grief changes people. In this wonderful book, Jozefowski offers sage advice and inspiration to both counselors and grieving persons that will help them grow even in the midst of loss. (Kenneth Doka, Ph.D., author, Spirituality and Grief)<br><br>This is an inspirational book for psychotherapists, physicians, clergy, and all of us who must learn to keep living when someone we love has died. Dr. Jozefowski teaches us that grief is not about letting go but making contact: with our loved one, emotions, self, community, values, and hopes. She and her patients show us that these connections can be transforming and, like the Phoenix, can permit one of our saddest moments to become an occasion for rebirth. (Nicholas A.

Alison Bechdel continues to illuminate the way we live through the comic strip serial that has become a national treasure. In the tenth book in the series, Mo, the curmudgeonly women&#x2019;s bookstore clerk, blithely rants about Dr. Laura, Donald Rumsfeld, gay Enron execs, and the pernicious effects of Frogger, while her cozy counterculture community is shifting beneath her feet. Her job is in jeopardy as Madwimmin Books&#x2019;s customer base defects to the chains. Her ex, Clarice, is displaying symptoms of soccer mom-itis. Her best friend, Lois, has announced her new name is Louis. And her old pal Sparrow considers whether having a baby with her boyfriend will compromise her identity as a radical lesbian feminist. Meanwhile, Toni doesn&#x2019;t know what do when Clarice&#x2019;s George W. Bush-induced depression lasts long after the inauguration and, in the wake of 9-11, her friends square off on questions of idealism, violence, compassion, patriotism, and dissent. As they hash out their ideological differences, a black-and-white world takes on surprisingly variegated shades of gray.</p><p><b>Alison Bechdel</b> is the author of nine previous <i>Dykes to Watch Out For</i> books, three of which have been Lambda Literary Award winners, as was also her autobiography, <i>The Indelible Alison Bechdel</i>. She lives in Vermont.</p></p><p>Alison Bechdel has been writing and illustrating &#34;Dykes to Watch Out For&#34; since 1982.

She lives in Vermont and is working on a grapThat sprawling crew of feisty counter- and not-so-counter-culturalists are back in a 20th-anniversary collection of Bechdel's popular lesbian-themed strip. Devoted readers may be happy to find some things never change: Mo is still a social malcontent, and her colleague, Lois, is as rebellious as ever. (This time, she's tweaking Mo by pretending to consider becoming a man.) The bookstore where they work has its usual financial difficulties, and everyone still hates the president. But not all is as it once was. For one thing, same-sex marriages (well, unions) are now legal in Vermont, and one couple, Clarice and Toni, consider whether to make their relationship official in the state's eyes. Then there's Sparrow: a long-time member of the group house where Lois lives, who has fallen in love with another housemate-a man-and seems to be unexpectedly pregnant. And Ginger, an academic, is facing the purgatory of a non-tenured position at an undistinguished school; buried under papers to grade, she barely even notices when a lovely waitress at a local juice bar makes a move. While first-time readers may lack the back story that's developed over the past two decades with these and several other characters, Bechdel is a master of interwoven plot lines, and she sprinkles helpful summaries through the panels so new readers can tell where they are in the tale. An introduction covering highlights of the past 20 years illustrates how far Bechdel has come; from impressionistic sketches to work that is rich, funny, deep and impossible to put down. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book begins over a million years ago with a discussion of how the earliest ideas might have originated. Looking at animal behaviour that appears to require some thought: tool-making, territoriality, counting, language (or at least sounds), pairbonding. </p><p>Peter Watson moves on to the apeman and the development of simple ideas such as cooking, the earliest language, the emergence of family life. All the obvious areas are tackled: the Ancient Greeks, Christian theology, the ideas of Jesus, astrological thought, the soul, the self, beliefs about the heavens, the ideas of Islam, the Crusades, humanism, the Renaissance, Gutenberg and the book, the scientific revolution, the age of discovery, Shakespeare, the idea of Revolution, the Romantic imagination, Darwin, imperialism, modernism, Freud right up to the present day and the internet.</p></p><p>Peter Watson was born in 1943 and educated at the universities of Durham, London and Rome. He was deputy editor of NEW SOCIETY and spent four years as part of the &#39;Insight&#39; team of THE SUNDAY TIMES.

Dynamically designed, Hillbilly Hollywood is as much a collector's piece as the costumes it features.</p></p><p>Debby Bull is a former contributing editor and writer at Rolling Stone magazine. A rock critic and popular-culture observer, she is also the author of Blue Jelly, a memoir.You will adore this devastatingly visual sendup. It s almost spiritually respectful of the excesses and outrages of the singers and other performers who were drawn by the hope of glory and riches from Depression-era rural outposts to Los Angeles. The photographs are blazing with costumes that are as kitschy as anything ever worn by living humans. --The Baltimore Sun<br><br>Rhinestone cowboys and fringed cowgirls kick up their boot heels in Hillbilly Hollywood, a close look at that the author calls famous people you ve never heard of. With a rhinestone-studded and die-cut cover, the book is as flamboyant as its subject. --The New York Times<br><br>Back in the 1940s, cowboy stars like Gene Autry were Hollywood royalty. And their fancy, Western-tailored suits, flamboyantly embroidered or sparkling in sequins, left a permanent imprint on American style, former Rolling Stone editor Debby Bull writes in this curiously engaging coffee-table volume. The pictures of gussied up C&amp;W performers are fun, and the performers themselves add some perspective.

In the Pyrenees mountains near Carcassonne, Alice, a volunteer at an archaeological dig, stumbles into a cave and makes a startling discovery-two crumbling skeletons, strange writings on the walls, and the pattern of a labyrinth. \n\nEight hundred years earlier, on the eve of a brutal crusade that will rip apart southern France, a young woman named Alais is given a ring and a mysterious book for safekeeping by her father. The book, he says, contains the secret of the true Grail, and the ring, inscribed with a labyrinth, will identify a guardian of the Grail. Now, as crusading armies gather outside the city walls of Carcassonne, it will take a tremendous sacrifice to keep the secret of the labyrinth safe.</p><p>Kate Mosse is the cofounder and honorary director of the prestigious Orange Prize for Fiction. A fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, she was named European Woman of Achievement for her contribution to the arts in 2000. She presented BBC 4's flagship <i>Readers and Writers Roadshow</i> and is a guest presenter on BBC Radio 4's <i>Saturday Review</i>.With more than 500 audiobook titles to her credit, Golden Voice Wanda McCaddon, a.k.a. Donada Peters, is a sure bet to please listeners in this complex quest tale. The story revolves around 13th-century Alais and 21st-century Alice, bound together by a sacred trilogy of ancient books. Mysticism, ancient hieroglyphs, and secret societies add to the puzzle as Alais struggles to save the manuscripts and Alice wrestles with blackouts and memories reincarnated from someone else's past. Peters reads with gusto. The intelligence in her voice resonates in this story of the Crusades, religious persecution, murder, imprisonment, and torture. This smart book, enhanced by an accomplished reading by Peters, provides hours of engrossing listening.

Over the 55 years since she appeared on <i>American Bandstand</i>, Arlene has been featured in many books, as well as television, radio, and internet interviews. Her friendships with many stars include Bobby Rydell, Frankie Avalon, Fabian, Dion, and Charlie Gracie. Throughout the years, Arlene attended all Dick Clark's reunions and specials. She also appeared on the <i>Oprah Winfrey Show</i> along with some other Regulars to surprise Dick Clark. <p> <b>Ray Smith</b> was born and raised in Philadelphia and went to John Bartram High School along with a lot of local celebrities including: Danny and The Juniors; Patti LaBelle; Lee Andrews &amp; The Hearts; opera singer Florence Quivar; basketball great Earl "The Pearl" Monroe; and Bandstand regulars, Arlene Sullivan, Peggy Leonard, and Justine Carrellli. Ray first attended <i>Bandstand</i> in the summer of 1956. He danced on the show until Christmas 1959. In 1960, he attended Penn State as a labor relations major. In 1964, he joined the National Guard and did basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. After working in insurance in Philadelphia, and studying acting and dance, Ray moved to New York City in 1966. He studied ballet at Richard Thomas's parents' studio, tap dance with Henry LeTang, and acting at HB Studios. He joined NBC News in 1967 and worked on the <i>Today Show</i> until he retired in 2007. He still works on the show one day a week. In 2006, he won an Emmy as part of the show's news writing team. In the late 1990s, Ray served as company manager of Noche Flamenca, the most popular and successful flamenco dance company in the world. Ray has been a contributor to several books on rock 'n' roll.

She watched <i>American Bandstand</i> from 1957 to 1961 on her parents' small Motorola television set, dancing remotely with the Regulars and using her basement door knob as her dance partner. She had a big crush on Bob Clayton, which she shared with him during her interview with him for <i>Bandstand Diaries</i>. She is a journalism graduate of New York University. Over her career, Sharon has been a copywriter at Simon &amp; Schuster, ran a nanny-housekeeping agency, and created Long Island's first 50-Plus Expos. Sharon's curiosity about "whatever became of the <i>American Bandstand</i>'s Regulars" from the Philadelphia days led her to meet co-author Arlene Sullivan to discuss writing the first book about the Regulars. She went on to interview over 40 Regulars for <i>Bandstand Diaries</i>.

(July)</p><p><b>MARGARET MARON</b> grew up in the country near Raleigh, North Carolina, but for many years lived in Brooklyn, New York. When she and her artist husband returned to the farm that had been in her family for a hundred years, she began a series based on her own background. The first book, <i>Bootlegger's Daughter</i>, became a <i>Washington Post </i>bestseller that swept the major mystery awards for its year-winning the Edgar, Agatha, Anthony, and Macavity Awards for Best Novel-and is among the 100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century as selected by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Later Deborah Knott novels <i>Up Jumps the Devil</i>, <i>Storm Track</i>, and <i>Three-Day Town</i> each also won the Agatha Award for Best Novel. Margaret is also the author of the Sigrid Harald series of detective novels. In 2008, Maron received the North Carolina Award for Literature, the highest civilian honor the state bestows on its authors. And in 2013, the Mystery Writers of America celebrated Maron's contributions to the mystery genre by naming her a Grand Master-an honor first bestowed on Agatha Christie. To find out more about her, you can visit MargaretMaron.com.In this eighth book in the Judge Deborah Knott series (after 2000's Storm Track), Maron employs spare, straightforward prose and the languid language of the Carolina Piedmont to spin an exceptionally gripping tale of hate, jealousy and murder. Still smarting from the betrayal of her lover, Kidd Chapin, the redoubtable jurist travels to Randolph County, N.C., in order to settle the equitable distribution of the marital property of a pair of freshly divorced potters, Sandra Kay Nordan and James Lucas Nordan. Before she can finish her legal duties, however, somebody bakes James Lucas in a kiln. Deborah's own sense of loss in the wake of Kidd's rejection helps her empathize with patriarch Amos Nordan's multiple tragedies (another son died two years earlier) as well as a hired woman's grief over her retarded son. Amidst a beautifully evoked flowering spring countryside, Deborah pursues the murderer with her usual keen eye and common sense. If the book fairly swells with passion, a healthy dose of Southern humor keeps things from getting too maudlin. By the time the story reaches its dramatic conclusion, readers will be in mourning, wishing the end hadn't come so soon. Maron's mastery of jurisprudence, her well-researched depiction of the potting world but especially her sensitive portrayal of human relationships raise this novel far above the ordinary run of mysteries.

He was one of the most prolific writers in England during the early twentieth century. He was known as a writer, orator, poet, satirist, man of letters, and political activist. He is most notable for his Catholic faith, which had a strong impact on most of his works and his writing collaboration with G. K. Chesterton. He was President of the Oxford Union and later MP for Salford from 1906 to 1910. He was a noted disputant, with a number of long-running feuds, but also widely regarded as a humane and sympathetic man.</p><h2>Love Among the Ruins</h2><p>A cast of characters quickly gathers around the Winters, including many faces familiar from Thirkell&#39;s earlier Barsetshire chronicles. Among the young and unattached are Charles Belton, newly-hired school master at the Priory School, and his elder brother, Captain Freddy Belton of the Royal Navy; Susan Dean, the Red Cross Depot Librarian and her sister, Jessica, an actress in thrall to the theatre; Lucy Marling, and her brother Oliver.</p><p>Angela Thirkell was born in London in 1890. Mrs. Thirkell did not begin writing novels until her return to Britain in 1930; then, for the rest of her life, she produced a new book almost every year until her death in 1961.Thirkell (1890-1961) wrote some 30 highly entertaining novels about life in the imaginary English county of Barsetshire (a setting invented by Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope). Her books achieved enormous popularity for their humorous style, subtle characterization and sympathetic portrayal of a class-conscious society. First published in 1948, Thirkell's ninth Barsetshire novel is, like her other confections, a story of English ladies and gentlemen and their irrepressible children, all of whom live in such fabulous country towns as Winter Overcotes and High Rising, where they talk delightful nonsense, fall acutely but not painfully in love and in general find life worth living despite the shortages and rationing of postwar Britain. The story begins at Beliers Priory, Barsetshire's preparatory school for boys. Prominent in the charming cast of eligible young men and women are Charles Belton, newly hired junior master; his elder brother, Freddy; the Dean sisters, Susan and Jessica; and the elegant young Clarissa Graham. Woven skillfully into the daily rounds of county life, their courtships and comic mishaps culminate at the tradition-shattering fair which for the first time combines the annual meeting of the Barsetshire Pig Breeders Association and a Conservative Party rally. This is vintage Thirkell, to be welcomed by longtime devotees as well as newcomers to her engaging fiction. <p></p><p>Copyright 1997 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Charlotte Salomon: Leven? of theater?

Tourgee&#39;s own career as a forceful advocate of civil rights was a bestseller in the 1880s and continues to occupy a place in the history of American literature. Judge Tourgee&#39;s reflections on the fundamental post- abolition problem of how to build a bridge from black emancipation to black equality provide readers with a clear picture of the South during the Reconstruction era. Presented as a work of fiction, this engaging and provocative work discusses Reconstruction and the many problems surrounding it. An introduction by George Fredrickson provides historical context for both the author and the novel.</p><p>American abolitionist and lawyer ALBION W.

It is the story of Comfort Servosse, a Union officer, who at the end of the Civil War decides to make his home in the South. The author tells of Servosse's reception there and the difficulties he and his family encounter in the trying years of Reconstruction, a portrait of these tragic years, the novel is especially interesting.

She fixed Mama blue cohosh tea to sip and tickled her nose with a feather.<br><br>Gran said, &#x201c;When your mama sneezed, you whizzed out of her like a pellet from a shotgun. All Doc Smythson had to do was hold out his hands to catch you.&#x201d; Gran shook her head. &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t like you have to go to some fancy school to learn how to do that!&#x201d;<br><br>But things sure turned out different with BJ. I recollect the whole thing. I was four years old at the time. Gramps and Daddy lived in Heaven by then. Me and Mama and Gran lived in Gramps&#x2019; cabin all by ourselves.<br><br>When BJ was about to come, Mama started bleeding real bad, and she screamed like a hound dog a-howling at the moon. Nothing Gran mixed from her herb bottles helped none. Gran sent me running to the neighbors&#x2019; house to have them find Doc Smythson.<br><br>Doc took one look at Mama and told Gran he had to fetch her to the hospital in Charleston straight away. But we didn&#x2019;t have no ambulance close by where we lived. Sometimes the men from the funeral home took folks to the hospital in their hearse. But they couldn&#x2019;t get to our house soon enough for my mama, tucked way back up in the mountains as we are.<br><br>So Gran wrapped Mama up in blankets, and Doc carried her like a sack of taters to his jeep. Her eyes was closed like she was asleep. I cried out to her, &#x201c;Take me with you, Mama! Take me with you!&#x201d;<br><br>She opened her eyes just a little and looked at me. Her lips said, &#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; but no sound come out at all. Doc sped off with her to the big hospital in Charleston.<br><br>Tears commenced to roll down my cheeks when I watched them drive away. Gran smoothed the hair back from my face with her hands, rough as a cat&#x2019;s tongue. &#x201c;Your mama needs us to stay here and look after things for her, pumpkin,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>When me and Gran went back inside, Gran pulled Mama&#x2019;s bloody sheets offen the bed and took them to the washtub. I couldn&#x2019;t bear to watch the water take Mama&#x2019;s blood away, thinking that was all I had left of her. So I runned under the kitchen table and curled up like a woolly worm that somebody poked with a stick.<br><br>After Gran got done a-scrubbing and a-hanging out the sheets to dry, she leaned under the table and took my hand. &#x201c;Come on, child,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Your mama needs us to be strong for her. Besides, I ain&#x2019;t got the bones for bending down like this. You ain&#x2019;t helping your mama none by hiding under the table. Let&#x2019;s fix up the cabin all nice for her and the baby to come home to.&#x201d; I crawled out, and Gran handed me a little broom Daddy made for me afore he died.<br><br>I got myself busy sweeping the floors ever day Mama stayed at the hospital. Gran said, &#x201c;Lydia, I declare, you&#x2019;re going to wear holes in the floor clean through to Chiny iffen you keep that up.&#x201d; But I wanted them floors to be spanking clean for my mama.<br><br>Mama finally comed back and brought my new baby brother with her. Gran folded up a blanket and laid it in a dresser drawer on Mama&#x2019;s bed for him to sleep in. It made me think of Baby Jesus in the manger to see him lying there all cozied up.<br><br>Mama named my brother Benjamin for my grandpa on Daddy&#x2019;s side and James for my gramps on Mama&#x2019;s side. But he looked just too little to be Benjamin James. I wanted to call him Ben Jim, but Gran said, &#x201c;Mercy, pumpkin, that sounds more like the name of a tonic than a fitting name for a boy. I can hear it on the radio now. &#x2018;Ben Jim heals your soul and heart, mends your body and makes you smart, keeps you strong and cures the farts.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>So we took to calling him BJ instead.<br><br>BJ looked as cute as a speckled steamboat on a spotted river, as Gran used to say, even iffen he was as skinny as a straight pin. He had big blue eyes the color of our pond when it froze over. Them eyes looked clean through you, right inside to your very soul. His hair was the color of a ripe ear of corn. I used to hold him on my lap and tell him stories--about our daddy, about living up here on the mountain, and about how much we all loved him. He&#x2019;d look at me and grin, and this little dimple would creep up like an extra smile.<br><br>Sometimes I&#x2019;d think he sure lucked out being that cute. All I got was plain brown hair, plain brown eyes, and a plain face. And a bunch of awful freckles. I asked Mama, &#x201c;How come I didn&#x2019;t get blue eyes like BJ?&#x201d; She said, &#x201c;You got soft, gentle doe eyes instead, Lydia. Eyes just like your heart.&#x201d; I felt better after that.<br><br>BJ was so tiny he made me come to think of Tom Thumb--a story Gran used to tell me about a little boy the size of his daddy&#x2019;s thumb. BJ mewed like one of our old cat Hessie&#x2019;s kittens when he wanted a drink from Mama&#x2019;s breast. His sucking sounded like purring almost. Sometimes I wished that I could curl up with Mama like that--all safe and warm. But I thought I was too big because Mama was so weak. Feeding BJ seemed about all she could manage. So I didn&#x2019;t ask. Besides, I had to help Gran with the cooking and other chores. I didn&#x2019;t mind so much. I pretended I was all growed up and a real important person.<br><br>One day while Mama slept, Gran let me hold BJ for the very first time. I had to sit in the rocking chair and be real careful. His neck still flopped about like my rag doll. I curled my arm around him when Gran laid him in my lap. He didn&#x2019;t weigh much more than a mess of green beans. I looked down at his big eyes, and he looked up at me. &#x201c;Looky there,&#x201d; Gran said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a-smiling at you.&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled back at him. I knew right then and there that I was somebody special to my baby brother. &#x201c;I will always take good care of you, BJ,&#x201d; I promised in a whisper only he could hear. &#x201c;Always and forever. I won&#x2019;t let nothing bad happen to my BJ.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried real hard to keep that promise, but I couldn&#x2019;t. Gran always reminded us when something bad happened that the rain falls on the just and the unjust. The rain that Gran talked about sure poured down mighty hard on our family.</p><h2>The New Single Malt Whiskey: More Than 325 Bottles, From 197 Distilleries, in More Than 25 Countries</h2><p>The most definitive guide to the new revolution in single malt whiskey across the globe, complete with cocktail recipes, bottle reviews, tasting notes, distiller interviews,&nbsp;and contributions from award winning experts!<br><br><b>The Most Dynamic Chapter in the History of Whiskey is Being Written Now</b>!

Soon after, the newly constructed vessel, crowded with passengers and livestock, erupted into flames and sank in the river below, taking much of the bridge with it.</p><p>As lawyer and Lincoln scholar Brian McGinty dramatically reveals in <em>Lincoln's Greatest Case</em>, no one was killed, but the question of who was at fault cried out for an answer. Backed by powerful steamboat interests in St. Louis, the&nbsp;owners of the <em>Effie Afton</em> quickly pressed suit, hoping that a victory would not only prevent the construction of any future bridges from crossing the Mississippi but also thwart the burgeoning spread of railroads from Chicago. The fate of the long-dreamed-of transcontinental railroad lurked ominously in the background, for if rails could not cross the Mississippi by bridge, how could they span the continent all the way to the Pacific?</p><p>The official title of the case was <em>Hurd et al. v. The Railroad Bridge Company</em>, but it could have been <em>St. Louis v. Chicago</em>, for the transportation future of the whole nation was at stake. Indeed, was it to be dominated by steamboats or by railroads? Conducted at almost the same time as the notorious <em>Dred Scott</em> case, this new trial riveted the nation&#x2019;s attention. Meanwhile, Abraham Lincoln, already well known as one of the best trial lawyers in Illinois, was summoned to Chicago to join a handful of crack legal practitioners in the defense of the bridge. While there, he succesfully helped unite the disparate regions of the country with a truly transcontinental rail system and, in the process, added to the stellar reputation that vaulted him into the White House less than four years later.</p><p>Re-creating the <em>Effie Afton</em> case from its unlikely inception to its controversial finale, McGinty brilliantly animates this legal cauldron of the late 1850s, which turned out to be the most consequential trial in Lincoln's nearly quarter century as a lawyer. Along the way, the tall prairie lawyer's consummate legal skills and instincts are also brought to vivid life, as is the history of steamboat traffic on the Mississippi, the progress of railroads west of the Appalachians, and the epochal clashes of railroads and steamboats at the river&#x2019;s edge.</p><p><em>Lincoln's Greatest Case</em> is legal history on a grand scale and an essential first act to a pivotal Lincoln drama we did not know was there.</p> 18 illustrations</p><p>Brian McGinty is an attorney and writer who specializes in American history and law. His previous books include Lincoln&#39;s Greatest Case, The Body of John Merryman: Abraham Lincoln and the Suspension of Habeas Corpus, and John Brown&#39;s Trial. He lives in Scottsdale, Arizona.&#x201c;McGinty provides valuable context unavailable anywhere else and a deep understanding of the dynamic and contested legal, commercial, and political world that informed Lincoln&#x2019;s support for westward expansion and economic development, shaped his ideas on law, and honed his skills as a lawyer. McGinty&#x2019;s book gives us the best accounting of Lincoln, the lawyer, to date. Highly recommended.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Randall M. Miller, <em>Library Journal (Starred Review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;McGinty makes good on his promise to articulate why a now obscure 1857 trial had much broader significance than one would expect of a legal battle over transportation....A masterful popular history that places its focal point in a richly detailed wider context and will get readers interested in Lincoln&#x2019;s legal career.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating study of the case that capped Lincoln's career as a lawyer and fostered the creation of the vast railroad network that would bind the nation together.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard Slotkin, author of <em>The Long Road to Antietam</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Brian McGinty's riveting account of the <em>Effie Afton</em> trial of 1857 not only highlights the role of Abraham Lincoln in assuring the superiority of railroad transport over river navigation in the nation's development but also how the case gave a boost to Lincoln's career both as a lawyer and as a political leader.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James M. McPherson, author of <em>Embattled Rebel: Jefferson Davis as Commander in Chief</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Accomplished legal historian Brian McGinty has provided the definitive account of a crucial episode in Abraham Lincoln's career as an attorney: the precedent-setting <em>Effie Afton</em> case. McGinty deftly explains the judicial and political implications of this effort by Lincoln to establish the inevitability (and desirability) of economic development in the West, and does so through superior research, fine reasoning, and lucid prose. <em>Effie Afton</em> was much more than an ordinary legal case&#x2015;and this book is much more than a mere account of a pre-Civil War trial. Anyone seeking to better understand the origins of the growing tensions between political parties in mid-nineteenth-century America will find this book absolutely essential.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Harold Holzer, Roger Hertog Fellow, New-York Historical Society</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Of the 5,000-plus cases in which attorney Abraham Lincoln participated, none had more national significance than the one that Brian McGinty so ably describes and analyzes in this highly readable volume. Based on thorough research, McGinty not only sheds bright light on Lincoln's contribution to the defense of the bridge company but also places the story within the larger context of American economic, social, and military history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Burlingame, author of <em>Abraham Lincoln: A Life</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;As Brian McGinty demonstrates so well in his latest book, Lincoln showed great&nbsp;political courage as an attorney when he was called upon to defend progress in 1857. While Lincoln successfully defended the Rock Island Railroad from claims of the owners of the river boat <em>Effie Afton</em>, he was also a successful mediator, recognizing the importance of both modes of transportation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Frank J. Williams, founding chairman of the Lincoln Forum</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A lively account of this navigational dispute and its central role in America&#x2019;s economic and political development... <em>Lincoln&#x2019;s Greatest Case</em> convincingly shows that 1857 was a watershed year for the moral and political questions surrounding slavery&#x2019;s expansion to the west... The book is also a case study of discomfort with new technology&#x2015;and the futility of using a tort suit to prevent the adoption of inevitable innovation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Margaret A. Little, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes, while the future seems to lie in the establishment of invisible connections, it can be rewarding to look to the past, when it was infrastructure that held the promise of unity. McGinty enlivens this history of pre-Civil War America.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Elizabeth Taylor, <em>Chicago Tribune</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;McGinty does a masterful job bringing this 157-year-old case to life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Holahan, <em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong></p><h2>Tokyo Fiancee</h2><p>Am�lie Nothomb brings humor, intelligence, and a refreshing honesty to this highly autobiographical work. Her storytelling appeals to those who feel that their own immediate and personal sense of love is seldom adequately represented in popular fiction.&nbsp;<br><br>Am�lie is a young language teacher living in Tokyo. When she succumbs to the attentions of her one and only student&#x2014;the shy, wealthy, and sincere&nbsp;Rinri&#x2014;the two find themselves in an vibrant affair that is as unusual as it is tender. As their&nbsp;relationship unfolds, revelations emerge on foreigness, communication, age, and the fluctuating nature of love.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Tokyo Fianc�e</i>&nbsp;foregoes conventions to create a compelling image of love for the contemporary woman, an anti-Prince-Charming story that is an antidote to traditional romantic fables.</p><p>Am�lie Nothomb was born in Japan to Belgian parents in 1967. She lives in Paris. Since her debut on the French literary scene a little more than a decade ago, Am�lie Nothomb has published a novel a year, every year. Her edgy fiction, unconventional thinking, and public persona have combined to transform her into a worldwide literary sensation. Nothomb's books have been translated into over fifteen different languages and been awarded numerous prizes, including the French Academy&#x2019;s 1999 Grand Prix for the Novel, the Ren�-Fallet prize, the Alain-Fournier prize, and the Grand Prix Giono in 2008.A darling of the French literary scene, Nothomb delivers a complex story of first love set in late 1980s and early 90s Tokyo. Am�lie is a 21-year-old Belgian student studying Japanese in Tokyo when she begins tutoring Rinri, a sweet, shy and wealthy 20-year-old, in French. The relationship quickly evolves into a friendship and, soon after that, into romance. Rinri is a young soul who is easily swept up in his love for Am�lie, and his charm is undeniable as he courts her, but Am�lie wrestles with the classic situation: she loves spending time with Rinri, but she doesnt love him, and she cannot deny her need for independence. Nothomb thankfully forgoes the standard approach to passion and unrequited love, leading the reader to hope the adorable couple dont get married and instead find their own separate happiness. Nicely told, intimate and honest, the book depicts perfectly a nontraditional romance. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It pictures men who are reduced to the basics physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

It outlines a closed society's methods of developing rules which allow members to live together in harmony.<br><br>It is a story of hope, for it suggests that the techniques used by POWs to survive their conditions can be used by others to overcome similar situations faced in day-to-day living.</p><p></p><h2>The Dome Builder&#39;s Handbook: No. 1</h2><p>Contains an introduction on the theory of domes and 20 articles by various contributors on the practice.

His wives, Hagar and Sarah, though also pivotal in the story, have received far less attention. In this book, however, noted Jewish, Christian, and Muslim scholars focus on Hagar, Sarah, and their children, from Ishmael and Isaac to their many descendents through the centuries.</p><p>Moving from ancient and medieval sources to contemporary appropriations of the Sarah and Hagar story, the authors begin with an overview of the three religions--from their scriptural beginnings to their contemporary questions. They then explore how the story was developed after its canonization, in rabbinic interpretations, in the stories of Islam, and in the teachings of the early church fathers. They also present contemporary womanist and feminist perspectives. Timely, relevant, and provocative, this book provides an entree into interreligious discussion and understanding.</p></p><p><b>Phyllis Trible</b> is University Professor of Biblical Studies at Wake Forest University Divinity School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

The untutored reader of the Apocalypse is often puzzled by the diverse array of interpretations available to him. Symbolically the Revelation describes visions for the benefit of seven churches: a throne and a scroll; seals, trumpets, and bowls; horsemen, locusts, and scorpions; a dragon and a monster; two women and two cities. Do these symbols correspond to anything past, present, or future in our experience? Professor Caird stresses that John was a pastor, writing with a passionate concern for ordinary men and women to understand what he had been charged to tell them. If only we could put our- selves in the place of those early Christians, we would find that John said exactly what he meant and that he is his own best interpreter. The purpose of this commentary is to carry the reader back to the end of the first century A.D. to hear what the Spirit was saying to the churches then, so that, returning to the present, he may be better able to hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches of our own day. Accompanied by Dr. Cairds own fresh translation from the original Greek, this work provides a wealth of historical and linguistic information as the author examines the nature of John&#39;s experience, the structure of the book, and its theological message.

At its center, James P. Duffy relates the story of the sinking of the British liner <i>Laconia</i> by the German U-boat <i>U-156</i>. </p><p>On September 12, 1942, as <i>Laconia</i> sailed crowded with 1,800 Italian prisoners of war, 103 Polish soldiers, 286 mostly severely wounded British military personnel, 80 civilians, and 463 officers and crew, she was hit by two torpedoes fired by <i>U-156</i>. <i>Laconia</i>&#x2019;s captain ordered the vessel abandoned, and within an hour, she sank. Perhaps surprisingly, the German U-boat then surfaced and sent a signal that brought two other U-boats, an Italian submarine, and three Vichy French warships to assist with rescue operations.</p><p>The rescue operation by German ships and the subsequent bombing raid by Allied aircraft are both compelling stories and events that had major repercussions for the conduct of the war.&nbsp;In the wake of the incident, German admiral Karl D�nitz issued instructions known as the Laconia Order demanding that all attempts to rescue survivors from Allied merchant ships be ended. The order provoked an international outcry against inhumane treatment of survivors stranded at sea. After the war, D�nitz was charged with and acquitted of war crimes in connection with this order.</p></p><p>James P. Duffy is a writer who specializes in military history.

Most Lindbergh books do not describe, for example, the multiple parties who met with Charles Lindbergh and his allies, who were trusted with large sums of money, and made supposed negotiations with kidnappers. Noel Behn ambitiously tries to cram in as many details as he can about the events following the kidnapping, and to a large extent succeeds in convincing readers that an elaborate subterfuge was engineered by the Lindbergh camp. His proposed solution to the mystery is well researched, cogent, and fascinating. Behn's writing style makes for slow reading, though, so <i>Lindbergh: The Crime</i> is best read by someone who is already familiar with the case. The book includes 50 pages of footnotes, bibliography, and index. It was a 1994 finalist for an Edgar Award in fact crime.Behn (Seven Silent Men, 1984, etc.) reopens a celebrated criminal case--the kidnap/murder of Charles A. Lindbergh's infant son--and renders plausible if conjectural verdicts startlingly at odds with those on the official record. So far as history is concerned, an illegal German alien named Bruno Richard Hauptmann snatched the revered aviator's firstborn from the family's New Jersey estate on the night of March 1, 1932, and, though he killed the child almost immediately, collected a $50,000 ransom. When arrested in N.Y.C. over two years later, Hauptmann was found to possess much of the ransom; tried and convicted on homicide charges, he was executed on April 3, 1936. But here--drawing on hitherto unknown evidence unearthed by the Garden State's Republican governor (a political foe of Hauptmann's prosecutor) during the appeal process, as well as on government archives and other sources--Behn tells a different story. Toward the close of his inquiry (which provides vividly detailed perspectives on the times as well as the places in which the tragedy unfolded), the author makes a credible case against an individual who had the means, motive, and opportunity to kill the baby three days earlier than the murder was previously believed to have occurred. Prior to this shocker, he identifies the rogue who most likely wrote a series of ransom notes, and makes a fine job of sorting out the roles played by the sordid drama's large supporting cast--including John F. Condon, J. Edgar Hoover, Gaston Means, H. Norman Schwarzkopf (father of the Desert Storm general), et al. Throughout, Behn speculates that Lindbergh himself may have masterminded a sophisticated coverup that threw police off the track of the real murderer. At a minimum, the author argues, Hauptmann (whose trial he deems a travesty) was guilty of nothing worse than extortion. While his well-founded suspicions are not beyond all doubt, Behn's conclusions are reasonable and responsible in the circumstances--and are bound to attract considerable attention. True-crime fare, then, of a compellingly high order. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Visit Ian at IanMortimer.com.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><b><i>Welcome to Medieval England</i></b><br><br><p>What does the word "medieval" conjure up in your mind? Knights and castles? Monks and abbeys? Huge tracts of forest in which outlaws live in defiance of the law? Such images may be popular but they say little about what life was like for the majority. Imagine you could travel in time; what would you find if you went back to the fourteenth century? Imagine yourself in a dusty London street on a summer morning. A servant opens an upstairs shutter and starts beating a blanket. A dog guarding a traveler's packhorses starts barking. Nearby traders call out from their market stalls while two women stand chatting, one shielding her eyes from the sun, the other with a basket in her arms. The wooden beams of houses project out over the street. Painted signs above the doors show what is on sale in the shops beneath. Suddenly a thief grabs a merchant's purse near the traders' stalls, and the merchant runs after him, shouting. Everyone turns to watch. And you, in the middle of all this, where are you going to stay tonight? What are you wearing? What are you going to eat?</p><p>As soon as you start to think of the past <i>happening</i> (as opposed to it having happened), a new way of conceiving history becomes possible. The very idea of traveling to the Middle Ages allows us to consider the past in greater breadth -- to discover more about the problems which the English have had to face, the delights they found in life, and what they themselves were like. As with a historical biography, a travel book about a past age allows us to see its inhabitants in a sympathetic way: not as a series of graphs showing fluctuations in grain yields or household income but as an investigation into the sensations of being alive in a different time. You can start to gain an inkling as to why people did this or that, and even why they believed things which we find simply incredible. You can gain this insight because you know that these people are human, like you, and that some of these reactions are simply natural. The idea of traveling to the Middle Ages allows you to understand these people not only in terms of evidence but also in terms of their humanity, their hopes and fears, the drama of their lives. Although writers have traditionally been forced to resort to historical fiction to do this, there is no reason why a nonfiction writer should not present his material in just as direct and as sympathetic a manner. It does not make the facts themselves less true to put them in the present tense rather than the past.</p><p>In some senses this idea is not new. For many decades architectural historians have been re???creating images of castles and monasteries as they appeared in their heyday. Museum curators similarly have reconstructed old houses and their interiors, filling them with the furniture of a past age. Groups of individuals have formed reenactment societies, attempting to discover what it was like to live in a different time through the bold, practical experiment of donning period clothing and cooking with a cauldron on an open fire, or trying to wield a replica sword while wearing heavy armor. Collectively they remind us that history is much more than an educational process. Understanding the past is a matter of experience as well as knowledge, a striving to make spiritual, emotional, poetic, dramatic, and inspirational connections with our forebears. It is about our personal reactions to the challenges of living in previous centuries and earlier cultures, and our understanding of what makes one century different from another.</p><p>The nearest historians have come to considering the past at first hand is the genre of "what if ?" or "virtual history." This is where historians consider what would have happened if things had turned out differently. For example, what if Hitler had invaded Britain in 1940? What if the Spanish Armada had been successful? While such speculations are open to the obvious criticism that these things did not happen (with the implication that there is no point considering them), they have the great virtue of taking the reader directly to a moment in time and presenting events as if they were still unfolding. This can bring a real immediacy to a narrative. Put yourself in the shoes of the duke of Wellington at Waterloo, or Nelson at Trafalgar: they were only too well aware of the consequences of defeat. So too were their political masters back in England. <i>They</i> certainly considered the past that never was; so to reconstruct what might otherwise have happened brings us closer to those leaders in the moments of their decision-making. Just think: if Henry IV had not returned to Englandin 1399 to remove Richard II from power, we would have had several more years -- perhaps many more -- of Richard's tyrannical rule, probably resulting in the destruction of the Lancastrian dynasty and all those who supported it. In the spring of 1399 that likelihood was the key political issue and one of the reasons why Henry <i>did </i>return. It was also the principal reason why so many men supported him. In this way it is clear that seeing events as happening is crucial to a proper understanding of the past, even if the results are just as speculative now as they were at the time.</p><p>Virtual history as described above is only useful for understanding political events; it has relatively little value for social history. We cannot profitably speculate on what might have happened if, say, the Black Death had not come to Europe; it was not a matter of decisionmaking. But as with a reconstruction of a typical medieval house, virtual time travel allows us a clearer, more integrated picture of what it was like to live in a different age. In particular, it raises many questions which previously may not have even occurred to us and which do not necessarily have easy answers. How do people greet each other in the Middle Ages? What is their sense of humor like? How far away from home do individuals travel? Writing history from the point of view of our own curiosity forces us to consider a number of questions that traditional history books tend to ignore.</p><p>Medieval England is potentially a vast destination for the historical traveler. The four centuries between the Norman invasion and the advent of printing see huge changes in society. The "Middle Ages" are exactly that -- a series of ages -- and a Norman knight would find himself as out of place preparing for a late-fourteenth-century battle as an eighteenth-century prime minister would if he found himself electioneering today. For this reason, this guidebook concentrates on just one century, the fourteenth. This period comes closest to the popular conception of what is "medieval," with its chivalry, jousts, etiquette, art, and architecture. It might even be considered the epitome of the Middle Ages, containing civil wars, battles against the neighboring kingdoms of Scotland and France, sieges, outlaws, monasticism, cathedral building, the preaching of friars, the flagellants, famine, the last of the Crusades, the Peasants' Revolt, and (above all else) the Black Death.</p><p>Having emphasized that the focus of this book is fourteenthcentury England, a few caveats must be added. It is not possible to recover every detail of the period on the basis of fourteenth-century English evidence alone; sometimes the contemporary record is frustratingly incomplete. Also we cannot always be sure that the manner of doing something in 1320 necessarily held true in 1390. In some cases we can be sure that things changed dramatically: the entire nature of English warfare altered over this period, and so did the landscape of disease, with the catastrophic advent of the plague in 1348. Thus, where necessary, details from the fifteenth century have been used to inform descriptions of the later part of the fourteenth century, and the thirteenth century has been used to inform judgments about the early part. This blurring of time boundaries is only necessary where very difficult questions are raised. For example, we have relatively few sources underpinning our understanding of courtesy and manners in the fourteenth century whereas we have several excellent sources for the early fifteenth. Since it is unlikely that good manners developed overnight, the later evidence has been used as the fullest and most accurate available.</p><p>Many types of source material have been used in writing this book. Needless to say, contemporary primary sources are of vital importance. These include unpublished and published chronicles, letters, household accounts, poems, and advisory texts. Illuminated manuscripts show daily life in ways which the texts do not always describe: for example, whether women rode sidesaddle. A wealth of architectural evidence is available in the extant buildings of fourteenthcentury England -- the houses as well as the castles, churches, and monasteries -- and the ever-expanding literature about them provides even more information. In some cases we have documents which complement the architectural record: building accounts and surveys, for example. We have an increasing array of archaeological finds, from excavated tools, shoes, and clothes to the pips of berries found in medieval latrines, and fish bones on the waterlogged sites of ancient ponds. We have a plethora of more usual archaeological artifacts too, such as coins, ceramics, and ironware. The extent to which a good museum can give you an insight into how life was lived in the Middle Ages is restricted only by your own curiosity and imagination.</p><p>But most of all, it needs to be said that the very best evidence for what it was like to be alive in the fourteenth century is an awareness of what it is like to be alive in any age, and that includes today. Our sole context for understanding all the historical data we might ever gather is our own life experience. We might eat differently, be taller, and live longer, and we might look at jousting as being unspeakably dangerous and not at all a sport, but we know what grief is and what love, fear, pain, ambition, enmity...</p></p><h2>Your Thyroid and How to Keep It Healthy</h2><p>Thyroid problems, especially thyroid underactivity, are on the increase but notoriously difficult to diagnose.

Increasing disenchantment with the NHS decided him to enter private practice where he at once felt drawn to the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid problems. Much impressed by the work of Dr Broda Barnes in the USA, he visited the Barnes Foundation and returned to the UK determined to improve the lot of patients with thyroid illness. His emphasis on the use of clinical diagnosis, both of thyroid and adrenal problems, and an holistic approach using non-synthetic treatment, enjoyed a great deal of success but brought him into conflict with establishment medicine. He finally decided to retire from active medical practice to study nutrition, write and lecture. He wrote The Great Thyroid Scandal and How to Survive it (now revised as Your Thyroid and How to Keep it Healthy) for the general reader: to give people a deeper understanding of both thyroid and adrenal illness and enable them to play a knowledgeable part in the management of their treatment.

From the ancient world to the latest theories of cosmic physics, <i>The Book of the Cosmos</i> presents the art as well as the science of human attempts to describe the universe, not only in colorful scientific prose but also in engaging excerpts from poetry and philosophy, diaries and dialogues, essays and epistles, from writers as diverse as Aristotle, Copernicus, Cicero, Albert Einstein, and Edgar Allan Poe.Here, as never before in a single volume, we taste firsthand the exhilaration, flair, and occasional bewilderment of a hundred authors from across written history who shaped, and continue to shape, our view of the cosmos.</p><p>So many books published these days seem to deliberately ignore the forest for the trees, or the leaves, or the chloroplasts, or the chemistry of biopigments. Readers interested in big questions usually have to make do with the obligatory summing-up at the end, in which the author tries to justify his or her narrow interest through heroic feats of recontextualization. <i>The Book of the Cosmos: Imagining the Universe from Heraclitus to Hawking</i>, on the other hand, is 600 pages of well-expressed deep thought on the biggest picture of them all. In roughly chronological order, editor Dennis Danielson presents 85 sets of excerpts from big thinkers from biblical times to the present, introducing each to the modern reader with insightful running commentary that is consistently helpful without being obtrusive.<p> The ancient Greeks hit the ground running, leaving us a rich conceptual legacy, which we are still exploring and exploiting even as our own work becomes more and more machine-mediated. Danielson gives us a wide base of ancient thought to give a sense of our heritage. He includes both obvious choices, such as Plato, and lesser-known writers, such as Parmenides. The often neglected Middle Ages brought us Ptolemy, Moses Maimonides, and others who set the stage for the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, and the writings from these times betray an unexpected continuity of thought between the ancient and modern eras. Of course, the late-20th-century selections of such writers as Freeman Dyson and Steven Weinberg, which close the book, shouldn't imply an end to cosmological thinking. If anything, the last chapters of <i>The Book of the Cosmos</i> provoke a hunger for more. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Dennis Danielson is Professor of English at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, where he teaches honors and graduate courses in the literature of cosmology.

The Art and Fashion of Elsa Schiaparelli</h2><p>Elsa Schiaparelli (1890-1973) was the premier style arbiter of the 1930s - a favorite designer of women who made the best-dressed list, of female sports heroes, and of film and theater actresses. This book is the first comprehensive look at the work of this startling and innovative Paris fashion designer.</p><p>If you're a fashionista who's not a babe, you look for clothes that create attention all by themselves. That was the secret of Elsa Schiaparelli, the Italian designer who gave women unusual textures, eccentric patterns and surprising shapes influenced by the Surrealist artists in her circle. In <i>Shocking! The Art and Fashion of Elsa Schiaparelli</i>--a winking reference to her most famous perfume as well as to her designing audacity--Dilys E. Blum celebrates the couturiere whose achievements have long been eclipsed by her rival, Coco Chanel. A frustrated sculptor, Schiaparelli invested many of her garments of the 1930s and '40s with an architectural quality, from aerodynamic, back-swept bustles and overskirts dramatically curved back over themselves to stiff, fan-shaped peplums. She created a hat in the shape of an upside-down shoe, made comfy leopard-skin booties, and incorporated such novelties as monkey fur and Rhodophane, a transparent man-made fabric. Her clothes were worn by Mae West and heiress Millicent Rogers, by Helena Rubenstein and French film star Arletty. At her most eccentric, inspired by the artist Man Ray, Schiaparelli produced suede gloves with red snakeskin fingernails. At her most practical, she designed a daring (in 1931) silk tennis costume with a divided skirt. More than 300 stunning photographs, both vintage and contemporary, and a detailed yet lively text made this book a must for anyone interested in the history of fashion. A coordinated exhibition of the same title is at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, through Jan. 4, 2004, before traveling to Paris. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i>Dilys E.

They were talking to the old man with the gun.</i></p><p><i>The boy stood in the open, his pal Tim already in a squad car. Tim&#x2019;s old man&#x2019;s Coupe de Ville getting hooked up to a tow truck with spinning lights. His parents were going to freak.</i></p><p><i>Another cop was talking to the boy now, wanting to know how much they had to drink.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A beer. Maybe two.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s illegal,&#x201d; the cop said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re only seventeen.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said, not caring for a lecture, knowing he was screwed. &#x201c;No shit.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The cop just shook his head. He was young, maybe five years older than the boy. The cop stood ramrod straight, had hair clipped close like he&#x2019;d been in the military. He wrote down some notes, wanting to know the boy&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; phone number.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just my dad,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I live with my dad.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Is your mom alive?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t talk to her. Listen, this is a big mistake. We weren&#x2019;t doing nothing. We were just fooling around and that crazy old guy comes busting out the garage door waving his pistol and saying he was going to blow our brains out.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Why were you in his garage?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;We were lost,&#x201d; the kid said. &#x201c;We ran out of gas.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Is the car stolen?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not stolen,&#x201d; the kid said. &#x201c;It belongs to my friend. It was his grandfather&#x2019;s and then his father&#x2019;s. He rebuilt the engine. Now it&#x2019;s his. Kind of.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;What do you mean &#x2018;kind of&#x2019; his?&#x201d; the cop said.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s his,&#x201d; the kid said. &#x201c;His old man lets him use it when he wants.

Am I getting charged with something? Because I don&#x2019;t see what we did. I mean, we&#x2019;re not the one with the gun.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The cop looked over to a squad car and an older cop with stripes on his sleeve. The old man nodded to the younger. Out came the handcuffs.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; the kid said. &#x201c;I knew it. I fucking knew it.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>The night was gone, slipping into a dull bluish-gray morning, roadwork light when he&#x2019;d wake up and jog those five miles. Every day. Even Sunday. He wasn&#x2019;t an all-night-party kind of guy. But Tim had told his parents he was staying with him and he&#x2019;d told his dad he&#x2019;d be at Tim&#x2019;s. They didn&#x2019;t have anywhere to go after the party was over. There were girls and beer. Danielle had been there with that older guy and he wasn&#x2019;t about to leave first. Now the spinning blue lights.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re being charged with attempted burglary,&#x201d; the cop said.&nbsp;&#x201c;You got some beer in the car. And we found a controlled substance.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Shit.&#x201d; The girl from the party, the one Tim had made out with, had given them a few pills. They didn&#x2019;t know what they were, didn&#x2019;t even ask. Tim had tried to be cool, stick them in his pocket. Now they were drug dealers.</i></p><p><i>Yesterday morning, he&#x2019;d stood on the podium with a gold medal around his neck for winning his weight class in Worcester. His dad had been proud. His coach. His grandmother had cooked a big Italian meal for them, even turning off the TV as they said grace. She&#x2019;d made lasagna, a big salad to keep him healthy and in shape, ice cream since the next wrestling tournament was weeks away. It had been a perfect day. Damn near everything had clicked into place.</i></p><p><i>Now he was being pushed into the back of a squad car with Tim. He&#x2019;d like to be mad at his friend, but this wasn&#x2019;t his fault. No one forced him into that garage to see if they could find a can of gas. Controlled substance? Now he&#x2019;d be labeled a drug addict, too.</i></p><p><i>He tried to calm himself, think rationally. You let your head get filled with a bunch of junk and you can&#x2019;t think straight. What he did wasn&#x2019;t smart, but it wasn&#x2019;t the worst. He&#x2019;d tell his dad the truth. He&#x2019;d never lied to him. His dad knew some Blackburn cops and they&#x2019;d straighten out the whole mess.</i></p><p><i>This was a mistake. A really bad mistake, but just a screwup. Nothing like this ever screwed up a person&#x2019;s whole life. A person does the right thing every day of his life and that has to mean something. A kid pushes himself to run faster, lift more, not ever quit. You build up some kind of points for that. Right?</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Can I have my phone back?&#x201d; he said.</i></p><p><i>The cop didn&#x2019;t answer.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t I get to make a call?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You can do that at juvie intake,&#x201d; the cop said.

I had my pair of steel-toed Red Wings kicked up on the corner of my desk, thawing out, when she arrived. My morning coffee and two corn muffins were a distant memory.</p><p>She laid down the sandwich wrapped in wax paper and asked if my name was Spenser.</p><p>&#x201c;Depends on the sandwich.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A grinder from Coppa in the South End,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Extra provolone and pickled cherry peppers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then my name is Spenser,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;With an <i>S</i> like the English poet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rita said you were easy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you mean Rita Fiore, she&#x2019;s not one to judge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She also said you&#x2019;re tough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And hardheaded.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Also true,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And did she say if you scratched behind my left ear my leg would shake?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the woman said, squeezing into a client chair. &#x201c;But when I told her my problems, she said to go see Spenser.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And bring him a sandwich?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She said that would help.&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged and walked over to the Mr. Coffee on top of my file cabinet, poured a cup, and offered her one. She declined. I mixed in a little sugar, set the spoon on the cabinet, and moved back to my desk. My peacoat and Brooklyn Dodgers cap hung neatly from my coat tree.</p><p>&#x201c;You can go ahead and eat,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let it get cold.&#x201d;</p><p>I unwrapped the sandwich, which was still miraculously warm, and took a bite. I nodded with appreciation. The woman had indeed made a friend. Outside, traffic bustled and zoomed along Berkeley and Boylston. It was still early, but dark and insular, with snow predicted all week. I had crossed winter days off the calendar until opening day for the Sox.</p><p>&#x201c;My name is Sheila Yates,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Three weeks ago, my son Dillon was taken from me by the state of Massachusetts. He was sentenced to nine months in a juvie facility out in the harbor.&#x201d;</p><p>She motioned with her chin as if you could see the harbor from the Back Bay. I was still able to leap medium-size buildings in a single bound, but my X-ray vision was a bit iffy. Sheila was big and blond, with thick, overly styled hair, a lot of makeup, and gold jewelry. She wore a blue sweater and blue jeans under a heavy camel-colored coat. She also wore a lot of perfume, which in small quantities might have been pleasant.</p><p>&#x201c;What did he do?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Jack shit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What was he charged with?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Terrorism, stalking, and making physical threats against a school administrator.&#x201d;</p><p>I started to whistle, but my mouth was full. I chewed and swallowed and then took a sip of coffee.</p><p>&#x201c;You want to know what he really did?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;He set up a fake Twitter account for his vice principal,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a funny kid. Although some might say he&#x2019;s a smart-ass.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I like him already.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does any of this make sense to you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did your lawyer say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then?&#x201d; Sheila said. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t have a lawyer. I couldn&#x2019;t make the hearing. I had to work or I&#x2019;d get fired, so Dillon&#x2019;s grandfather took him. It&#x2019;s my mistake. I would have never signed that stupid piece of paper. It waived his right to an attorney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You bet your ass,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Rita&#x2019;s now got a young attorney at her firm to help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did he make threatening remarks on Twitter?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It was all a big joke. He may have wrote something about the guy getting his privates stuck in an appliance. He did say the guy liked to garden in the nude.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In all fairness,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;pruning shears could be dangerous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You get it,&#x201d; Sheila said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a gag.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been doing this for a long time,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And in those years it never ceases to amaze me the great wealth of people born without a sense of humor.&#x201d;</p><p>Sheila took in a large breath, threw her hands up in the air, jewelry clanging, and said, &#x201c;Oh, thank God,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;ll help me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What can I do?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Sounds like Rita&#x2019;s firm is on it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They are,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But while they&#x2019;re filing papers and stuff, I want to know how this crap happened. Rita says it&#x2019;s one of the craziest things she&#x2019;s ever heard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where was he charged?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Blackburn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The Riviera of the North.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t my choice to live there,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I grew up in Newton. I took a job there after I split with Dillon&#x2019;s dad. You do what you can.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. I reached over the sandwich for a yellow legal pad and wrote her name at the top left corner. I asked her for a phone number and an address. I asked her son&#x2019;s full legal name and his date of birth. She told me more about the charges and then a lot about the judge.</p><p>&#x201c;Judge Scali,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a class-A prick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, that&#x2019;s a campaign slogan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the Zero Tolerance for Minors guy,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You know who I&#x2019;m talking about now? He&#x2019;s all over the news and on the radio. He says what he does is tough love. Says parents that complain can deal with him now or go see their kids at Walpole later.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Never heard of him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, he&#x2019;s a big freakin&#x2019; deal in Blackburn,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Everyone up there is afraid of him. They think his word is God. The DA, the public defender, the cops. No one will listen to me. That&#x2019;s when I called Rita. I used to work in the business office at Cone, Oakes. I don&#x2019;t have a law degree, but I know when I&#x2019;m being jerked around.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s Dillon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t let me see him,&#x201d; she said, reaching into her purse for a tissue. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t let me talk to him but once every couple weeks. They say it&#x2019;s part of his rehabilitation out on Fortune Island. Rehabbing what? Being a wise guy? These people up there are nuts.&#x201d; She started to cry but then just as quickly wiped her eyes and sat up.</p><p>I leaned back into my chair. I crossed my arms over my chest. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t make any promises,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But I can check into things. Maybe find out something to help your attorney for appeals.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank God,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;When can you start?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked down at the day planner on my desk. I flipped through several empty pages. &#x201c;How about tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus, you mean it?&#x201d; she said, standing, coming around the desk. As I stood, she reached to hug me. I didn&#x2019;t return the embrace, only patted her back a couple times. &#x201c;You know I probably can&#x2019;t afford your day rate, whatever it is. I saw how much some snoops charged the firm.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Outrageous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;ll help anyway?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. She walked back to the client chair and grabbed her big purse. She did not sit. I looked down at my desk and saw my sandwich waiting, only one bite mark in place. The coffee had probably grown cold.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been able to sleep or eat since this happened. I blame my dad. I blame myself. The only person I don&#x2019;t blame is Dillon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t sound like it&#x2019;s his fault.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a good kid,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t deserve to be treated like this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody does.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone in Blackburn says I&#x2019;m an outsider,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They tell me to let this all play out. Keep my mouth shut. Don&#x2019;t piss people off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me piss &#x2019;em off,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;I heard you&#x2019;re good at that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had years of practice.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>Blackburn, Massachusetts, didn&#x2019;t appear on many tourist maps of New England. The old mill town, about thirty miles north of Boston on I-93, had lost any of its Norman Rockwell charm long ago. The huge brick mills stood like forgotten fortresses along the slow-moving black water of the Merrimack. The skies were gray. A light snow was falling. As I crossed over a rusting metal bridge, I saw ice chunks in the river. I made a mental note: only sixty-nine days until opening day.</p><p>I drove around a bit, cruising the downtown and Central Avenue toward the Victorian-era city hall. Most of the storefronts sat empty. I passed the police station, an all-night diner called The Owl, a Vietnamese grocery, and several corner bars. There was the high end of town with an upstart coffee shop and a ladies&#x2019; boutique. There was a low end of town with Farman&#x2019;s Salvage and a scratch-and-dent furniture warehouse. I soon ended up in front of Blackburn High School and parked in a space reserved for the school resource officer.</p><p>Might as well start making friends now.</p><p>Blackburn High looked to have been built in the twenties, constructed of blondish brick and dull glass blocks. According to a sign, it was home to the Fighting Eagles. I checked in at the office, as thuggish middle-aged men were often frowned upon for wandering school corridors. And these days, schools were locked down after the first bell.</p><p>A dour-looking woman in an oversized T-shirt reading ACHIEVE! issued me a badge, unlocked the entrance, and gave me directions to where I was headed.</p><p>The school had that familiar scent of old books and disinfectants. Being in school always tightened my stomach. My best day in high school had been graduation.</p><p>I found Officer Lorenzo sitting at his desk, hunched over a computer and not looking up even after I knocked on his open door. He was a fat guy with a couple chins in need of a shave. He wore a baseball hat, too small for his big head, with an embroidered law enforcement star reading BLACKBURN POLICE DEPARTMENT. I waited in the doorway until he could summon the energy to look up at me. To call his appearance slothlike was a true insult to the animal kingdom.</p><p>&#x201c;Fill out the form,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You can drop it at the front desk.&#x201d;</p><p>He had yet to look up.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t speak. Finally he lifted his eyes, refocusing.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not here for the form.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you a sub?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do I look like a sub?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You look like me,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;A guy who loads trucks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not here to award you officer of the year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ha, ha,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Then what the hell do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>I took a seat without being asked. His minuscule office was very sloppy, filled with stacks of newspapers, old copies of <i>Guns &amp; Ammo</i>, and a shelf full of playbook binders. He&#x2019;d fitted cardboard in the windows to keep out any light.

To begin with, Giovanni is ten years younger than I am, and, like most Italian guys in their twenties, he still lives with his mother. These facts alone make him an unlikely romantic partner for me, given that I am a professional American woman in my mid-thirties, who has just come through a failed marriage and a devastating, interminable divorce, followed immediately by a passionate love affair that ended in sickening heartbreak. This loss upon loss has left me feeling sad and brittle and about seven thousand years old. Purely as a matter of principle I wouldn't inflict my sorry, busted-up old self on the lovely, unsullied Giovanni. Not to mention that I have finally arrived at that age where a woman starts to question whether the wisest way to get over the loss of one beautiful brown-eyed young man is indeed to promptly invite another one into her bed. This is why I have been alone for many months now. This is why, in fact, I have decided to spend this entire year in celibacy.</p><p>To which the savvy observer might inquire: 'Then why did you come to <i>Italy</i>?'</p><p>To which I can only reply&#x2014;especially when looking across the table at handsome Giovanni&#x2014; 'Excellent question.'</p><p>Giovanni is my Tandem Exchange Partner. That sounds like an innuendo, but unfortunately it's not. All it really means is that we meet a few evenings a week here in Rome to practice each other's languages. We speak first in Italian, and he is patient with me; then we speak in English, and I am patient with him. I discovered Giovanni a few weeks after I'd arrived in Rome, thanks to that big Internet caf� at the Piazza Barbarini, across the street from that fountain with the sculpture of that sexy merman blowing into his conch shell. He (Giovanni, that is&#x2014;not the merman) had posted a flier on the bulletin board explaining that a native Italian speaker was seeking a native English speaker for conversational language practice. Right beside his appeal was another flier with the same request, word-for-word identical in every way, right down to the typeface. The only difference was the contact information. One flier listed an e-mail address for somebody named Giovanni; the other introduced somebody named Dario. But even the home phone number was the same.</p><p>Using my keen intuitive powers, I e-mailed both men at the same time, asking in Italian, "Are you perhaps brothers?"</p><p>It was Giovanni who wrote back this very <i>provocativo</i> message: "Even better. Twins!"</p><p>Yes&#x2014;much better. Tall, dark and handsome identical twenty-five-year-old twins, as it turned out, with those giant brown liquid-center Italian eyes that just unstitch me. After meeting the boys in person, I began to wonder if perhaps I should adjust my rule somewhat about remaining celibate this year. For instance, perhaps I could remain totally celibate <i>except</i> for keeping a pair of handsome twenty-five-year-old Italian twin brothers as lovers. Which was slightly reminiscent of a friend of mine who is vegetarian except for bacon, but nonetheless ... I was already composing my letter to <i>Penthouse</i>:</p><p><i>In the flickering, candlelit shadows of the Roman caf�, it was impossible to tell whose hands were caress</i>&#x2014;</p><p>But, no.</p><p>No and no.</p><p>I chopped tvhe fantasy off in mid-word. This was not my moment to be seeking romance and (as day follows night) to further complicate my already knotty life. This was my moment to look for the kind of healing and peace that can only come from solitude.</p><p>Anyway, by now, by the middle of November, the shy, studious Giovanni and I have become dear buddies. As for Dario&#x2014;the more razzle-dazzle swinger brother of the two&#x2014;I have introduced him to my adorable little Swedish friend Sofie, and how they've been sharing <i>their</i> evenings in Rome is another kind of Tandem Exchange altogether. But Giovanni and I, we only talk. Well, we eat and we talk. We have been eating and talking for many pleasant weeks now, sharing pizzas and gentle grammatical corrections, and tonight has been no exception. A lovely evening of new idioms and fresh mozzarella.</p><p>Now it is midnight and foggy, and Giovanni is walking me home to my apartment through these back streets of Rome, which meander organically around the ancient buildings like bayou streams snaking around shadowy clumps of cypress groves. Now we are at my door. We face each other. He gives me a warm hug. This is an improvement; for the first few weeks, he would only shake my hand. I think if I were to stay in Italy for another three years, he might actually get up the juice to kiss me. On the other hand, he might just kiss me right now, tonight, right here by my door ... there's still a chance ... I mean we're pressed up against each other's bodies beneath this moonlight ... and of course it would be a <i>terrible</i> mistake ... but it's still such a wonderful possibility that he might actually do it right now ... that he might just bend down ... and ... and ... Nope.</p><p>He separates himself from the embrace.</p><p>"Good night, my dear Liz," he says.</p><p>"<i>Buona notte, caro mio</i>," I reply.</p><p>I walk up the stairs to my fourth-floor apartment, all alone. I let myself into my tiny little studio, all alone. I shut the door behind me. Another solitary bedtime in Rome. Another long night's sleep ahead of me, with nobody and nothing in my bed except a pile of Italian phrasebooks and dictionaries.</p><p>I am alone, I am all alone, I am completely alone.</p><p>Grasping this reality, I let go of my bag, drop to my knees and press my forehead against the floor. There, I offer up to the universe a fervent prayer of thanks.</p><p>First in English.</p><p>Then in Italian.</p><p>And then&#x2014;just to get the point across&#x2014;in Sanskrit.<br><br><b>2</b><br><br>And since I am already down there in supplication on the floor, let me hold that position as I reach back in time three years earlier to the moment when this entire story began&#x2014;a moment which also found me in this exact same posture: on my knees, on a floor, praying.</p><p>Everything else about the three-years-ago scene was different, though. That time, I was not in Rome but in the upstairs bathroom of the big house in the suburbs of New York which I'd recently purchased with my husband. It was a cold November, around three o'clock in the morning. My husband was sleeping in our bed. I was hiding in the bathroom for something like the forty-seventh consecutive night, and&#x2014;just as during all those nights before&#x2014;I was sobbing. Sobbing so hard, in fact, that a great lake of tears and snot was spreading before me on the bathroom tiles, a veritable Lake Inferior (if you will) of all my shame and fear and confusion and grief.</p><p><i>I don't want to be married anymore</i>.</p><p>I was trying so hard not to know this, but the truth kept insisting itself to me.</p><p><i>I don't want to be married anymore. I don't want to live in this big house. I don't want to have a baby</i>.</p><p>But I was supposed to want to have a baby. I was thirty-one years old. My husband and I&#x2014;who had been together for eight years, married for six&#x2014;had built our entire life around the common expectation that, after passing the doddering old age of thirty, I would want to settle down and have children. By then, we mutually anticipated, I would have grown weary of traveling and would be happy to live in a big, busy household full of children and homemade quilts, with a garden in the backyard and a cozy stew bubbling on the stovetop. (The fact that this was a fairly accurate portrait of my own mother is a quick indicator of how difficult it once was for me to tell the difference between myself and the powerful woman who had raised me.) But I didn't&#x2014;as I was appalled to be finding out&#x2014;want any of these things. Instead, as my twenties had come to a close, that deadline of THIRTY had loomed over me like a death sentence, and I discovered that I did not want to be pregnant. I kept waiting to want to have a baby, but it didnt happen. And I know what it feels like to want something, believe me. I well know what desire feels like. But it wasn't there. Moreover, I couldn't stop thinking about what my sister had said to me once, as she was breast-feeding her firstborn: 'Having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face. You really need to be certain it's what you want before you commit.'</p><p>How could I turn back now, though? Everything was in place. This was supposed to be the year. In fact, we'd been trying to get pregnant for a few months already. But nothing had happened (aside from the fact that&#x2014;in an almost sarcastic mockery of pregnancy&#x2014;I was experiencing psychosomatic morning sickness, nervously throwing up my breakfast every day). And every month when I got my period I would find myself whispering furtively in the bathroom: <i>Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for giving me one more month to live</i> ... </p><p> </p><p></p></p><h2>Managing</h2><p>This 53 minute Audio CD covers a discussion with Harold Geneen, the former CEO of ITT; the man who built ITT to one of America&#39;s largest and fastest growing companies, provides insights into his unique management style and priorities.

For her twelfth birthday, Hills Aunt Pansy had one of her stories published in a book of short stories. This was the beginning of Hills career as a writer. In 1886, Hill and her family moved to Winter Park, Florida, where she got a job teaching gymnastics at a local college. She wrote her first real book there, in an effort to raise money for a family vacation to Chautauqua Lake. The book was called Chatauqua Idyl and was published in 1887 by D. Lothrop and Company, the same publisher that printed her first story when she was twelve. Hill was eventually married and began a family, but lost her husband to appendicitis. At this point in her life, her writing was the only means she had to keep food on the table and money in her pockets. In her lifetime, Hill wrote over a hundred books, only two of which were non-fiction. Grace Livingston Hill died in 1947 at the age of 82.</p><h2>Australia the Beautiful Cookbook</h2><p>Celebrating the abundance, variety, and individuality of the land down under, a colorfully illustrated cookbook features tasty and unusual dishes including Skewered Tiger Prawns with Honey Lime Butter, Tasmanian Atlantic Salmon Tartare, and Guava Sorbet.</p><p>Each title in this award-winning series offers an exquisite region-by-region taste tour filled with culinary specialties and surprises.

Inside that house, several generations of a family have grown up. Grandma and Grandpa arrived at the house from a country far away, and Mom and her brothers played on the steps on warm summer days. This little girl learned how to walk on that street, too. Hyewon Yum's <i>This is Our House </i>is a warm story with spare text that follows a family through seasons and generations, from the early days of immigration to the times that made their house into a home. <br><b>A Frances Foster Book</b></p></p><p><p><b>Hyewon Yum</b> is the critically acclaimed author of several previous picture books. Of <i>The Twins' Blanket</i>, <i>Publishers Weekly</i> said in a starred review that "Yum's third picture book shows the author/illustrator thoroughly at home with the picture book form." She studied painting and printmaking at Seoul National University in South Korea. She received her master of fine arts at the School of Visual Arts in New York City and presently lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p>Yum&#x2019;s latest resembles a photo album and follows a little girl offering up a historical tour of the house she shares with her parents, grandparents, and cat. She starts at the beginning, when her mother&#x2019;s parents &#x201c;arrived from far away with just two suitcases in hand.&#x201d; On one side of the spread (here and throughout the book) is a watercolor framed like a photograph; the other side reveals a more complete view from the same time period. The story continues, inside and in front of the two-story attached home, through her mother&#x2019;s childhood, departure for college, and return with &#x201c;the boyfriend who would be my father.&#x201d; Yum depicts the girl&#x2019;s grandparents as warm and welcoming, even as nervous new parents, and the girl&#x2019;s parents convey the same loving concern for their child. Some of the &#x201c;framed&#x201d; images pop up again on walls in later pages, suggesting how the young narrator learned the history she&#x2019;s relaying. Even before the baby sibling is introduced on the last spread, this is a sweet tribute to continuity and togetherness.

Using only methods of pure deduction, the eccentric, self-assured sleuth unravels the mysteries behind a wide range of criminal acts &#x2014; from gruesome murders ("The Lisson Grove Mystery") and daring thefts ("The Affair at the Novelty Theatre") to brilliant deceptions ("The Liverpool Mystery") and deadly blackmail schemes ("The Murder of Miss Pebmarsh"). <br>Set in the fog-shrouded streets of London, where gas lamps flicker in the gloom and details of lurid crimes splash across the pages of the daily papers, these ingenious, well-crafted stories by the author of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel </i>are among the first and great collections of detective fiction. They will delight devotees of Sherlock Holmes and other mystery-loving fans.</p><p></p><h2>Imitation of Christ: In Four Books</h2><p>Written five centuries ago by a humble monk, this timeless message of faith in Christ&#39;s teachings remains a vital source of spiritual strength for people seeking to follow in the footsteps of the Lord.</p><p>The Thomas � Kempis fan club includes St. Ignatius, Thomas Merton, Thomas More, and even Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. (She reads a chapter of <i>The Imitation of Christ</i> every night before sleep.) <i>Imitation</i> has exerted immense influence on Christian worship, ethics, and church structure, because it gives specific yet broad-minded guidance about the central task of Christian life--learning to live like Jesus. Better to read this book a little here and there, now and then, than to try gobbling it cover to cover. <i>Imitation</i> is no triumph of orderly thinking, but it's a great monument and incentive to deep living. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>When does a classic become new, fresh and extremely relevant? When someone takes it out of an outdated format and makes it readable, searchable and understandable. The Imitation of Christ has been in print for over 500 years for a good reason. It is powerful, beautiful and heart piercing. James Watkins has taken those words and reworked them into ninety daily readings, arranged by topic. Whether for daily devotions or for sound insight into a particular issue, Watkins paraphrase blends the ancient with the modern to introduce this classic to a new audience, speaking to all Christians with credibility and authority and using inclusive language not found in the original.</p><h2>Harriet Tubman: The Road to Freedom (Easy Biographies)</h2><p>The biography of a slave whose flight to freedom was the first step in her becoming a &#34;conductor&#34; on the underground railroad.</p><p></p><h2>Petty: The Classic Pin-Up Art of George Petty</h2><p>The first book on the art of the legendary pin-up artist, George Petty features rare images from Esquire centerfolds, pin-up calendars, and full-color ads, highlighted by a brilliant biographical text discussing the artist&#39;s life and work.</p><p>Even if you've never heard of George Petty, you're sure to recognize the airbrushed profile of the Petty Girl. She was the face (and legs) of the 1930s, the pinup World War II soldiers languished over, even part of the reason for <i>Esquire</i>'s early success. In this handsome portfolio of Petty's work, the Petty Girl shines in all her period glory, from <i>Esquire</i> centerfolds to hosiery ads to calendars. Reid Stewart Austin's accompanying biographical text illuminates Petty's battles with <i>Esquire</i> publisher David Smart, as well as his forays into Hollywood design and even merchandising. Petty's empire was a family business; his wife Jule helped think up ideas, and son George posed as the Petty Girl's date. Petty's main model, however, was his leggy daughter Marjorie, who contributes an introductory essay to this volume.Just as the cool, unapproachable Gibson Girl was the feminine ideal of young men at the turn of the century, the voluptuous Petty Girl ... became the ideal of their wide-eyed sons....

Her many award-winning novels include <i>Mary, Bloody Mary,</i> an ABA Pick of the Lists, an NCSS-CBC Notable Children's Trade Book in the Field of Social Studies, and an ALA Best Book for Young Adults; <i>Anastasia: The Last Grand Duchess</i>, a New York Times bestseller; <i>White Lilacs</i>, an ALA Best Book for Young Adults, an NYPL Best Book for the Teen Age, and an IRA Young Adults' Choice; and&nbsp;<i>Marie, Dancing, </i>a BookSense Pick<i>.</i>&nbsp;Ms. Meyer lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. <br><b>www.readcarolyn.com</b>Grade 7 Up-- In December 1860, a 34-year-old woman, Naduah--kidnapped 25 years earlier by Comanche Indians--was ``rescued'' by sol diers and returned to the white family who recognized her as their niece/sister/cousin Cynthia Ann Parker. Where the Broken Heart Still Beats tells her story. Naduah-Cynthia Ann was a real person, and Meyer skillfully interweaves fact and fiction in her book, alter nating third-person reminiscences of Naduah's life among the Comanche with journal entries by her 12-year-old cousin, Lucy (the most sen sitive and understanding of the Parkers). The struggle between the two ways of life is long and, in the end, unsuccessful. Both points of view, the Parkers' frustration at Cynthia Ann's reluctance to be ``civilized'' and Naduah's long ing for her Indian family and customs, are pre sented believably and without editorializing. The setting, Texas at the beginning of the Civil War, is smoothly integrated into the story; the captivating characters are well drawn. Meyer includes a map, a bibliography, and an author's note in which she discusses her research and ties loose ends together. Unaccountably miss ing is the information that Naduah-Cynthia Ann's son, Chief Quanah Parker, later located his mother's brother Silas and lived with the family for a time. This omission aside, Where the Broken Heart Still Beats is a fascinating look at the Comanche and their captives and will be enjoyed by teens who like historical fic tion and/or are interested in Native Americans and the West. --Ann W.

Tour.</p><p>When a North Korean freighter carrying a cargo of biological weapons runs aground in international waters off Cuba--Rear Admiral Jake Grafton wants go aboard, taking just one other man with him. His new chief of staff, Capt. Pascal, is skeptical and suggests that he takes along a half-dozen well-armed marines. Jake's reply is patient and succinct: "I don't know what's on that ship.... It just makes sense to have a point man explore the unknown before we risk very many lives. I am going to be the point man because I want to personally see what is there, and I make the rules. Understand?" Had Capt. Pascal been one of the millions of readers of Coonts's six previous books about Grafton, he wouldn't have raised the issue. Jake is a take-charge guy, the kind of believable hero trusted by his military superiors (if occasionally viewed as a loose cannon by politicians), and not even the possibility of an all-out war with Cuba is going to make him start playing it safe.<p> Fidel Castro is very close to death from cancer, and his chief aide plans to win the hearts of the Cuban population and gain control of the government by using a 40-year-old secret weapon against an American city. Meanwhile, Adm. Grafton and his carrier fleet have been sent to Guant�namo Bay in Cuba to supervise the removal of some U.S. biological weapons there. Very soon, Grafton and other Coonts regulars are up to their helmets in action on the air, land, and sea. Along the way, we meet a large cast of vivid supporting players: a Cuban family whose fate is closely linked to Castro's rise and fall and a CIA agent with the perfect cover--a lawyer for giant tobacco companies who want to make cigarettes in Cuba. We also increase our knowledge of military jargon: "strangling the parrot" means turning off a radar transponder. <i>Cuba</i> is an intriguing and surprisingly compassionate scenario, in which superb military action alternates with high family drama and political in-fighting. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>"[A] gripping and intelligent thriller." <i> -Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<p></p></p><h2>Journey of the Soul, 3 Book Box Set</h2><p>This very special gift set includes the three books that comprise Sylvia Browne&#x2019;s Journey of the Soul series: Book 1 God, Creation, and Tools for Life Does God exist? Was the world created, or did it evolve? Where am I in the big picture of the universe? Most people have asked these questions but have no clear answers. However, Sylvia does, and in this fascinating book, she shares her 40 years of investigation into these issues. Drawing from thousands of research sessions with Francine, her spirit guide, along with her own understanding of a number of riveting topics that are pertinent to humanity as a whole, you will have access to information that is mentally profound, spiritually moving, and eminently logical.<p> Francine, who resides on the Other Side, lives within the presence of God and has access to a wealth of knowledge about the nature of creation. Sylvia, then, becomes the human voice for Francine and is able to share the fruits of her wisdom. We are assured that God will respond to all questions&#x2014;our job is to ask the right questions and be receptive to the answers we receive. In so doing, we gain valuable tools for life! Book 2 Soul&#x2019;s Perfection Sylvia and her guides help solve a great mystery in this fascinating book&#x2014;namely, what is the meaning of life? Most human beings&#x2014;and many teachers and great scholars&#x2014; have pondered this question over the years, but there has never been a truly definitive answer. This leaves most of us with a feeling of being incomplete in some way. Here, Sylvia and her guides take you to that place within you where you can achieve a sense of intellectual and spiritual fulfillment. They explain that we are here to perfect our souls by absorbing God&#x2019;s knowledge. We are the experiencing side of God, where God is the primary intellect of creation.

If you wish to stand proudly before God some day, then the concepts discussed here will bring you wisdom, depth, and spiritual insight.</p><p>Book 3 The Nature of Good and Evil We constantly see the "senseless violence" in our world, and it begs the question: "How can an all-loving God allow this to exist?" Indeed, many people simply reject any notion of God for this very reason. This third book in Sylvia&#x2019;s Journey of the Soul series gives you the philosophical framework to understand the nature of good and evil&#x2014;and the role of God in the big picture. When you see how evil originated and why it thrives in our world, you&#x2019;re more prepared to face it and overcome it. Sylvia points out that you need not fear "evil spirits" or "curses"&#x2014;which are merely stories bred from ignorance. And how would you like to serve as one of God&#x2019;s warriors of Light? Sylvia explains how to enlist! By combining her philosophical and theological views, Sylvia creates a spiritual umbrella that rises above traditional religion. All paths that lead to knowing God have merit&#x2014;Sylvia simply invites you to know Him/Her in your own way, free of dogma and fear.

They are also an inspiration for Neil Gaiman&#39;s own award-bedecked, bestselling fiction. Now he reaches back through time to the original source stories in a thrilling and vivid rendition of the great Norse tales. Gaiman&#39;s gods are thoroughly alive on the page - irascible, visceral, playful, passionate - and the tales carry us from the beginning of everything to Ragnar�k and the twilight of the gods. Galvanised by Gaiman&#39;s prose, Thor, Loki, Odin and Freya are irresistible forces for modern readers and the crackling, brilliant writing demands to be read aloud around an open fire on a freezing, starlit night.</p><p></p><h2>Tom&#39;s Midnight Garden</h2><p>Lying awake at night, Tom hears the old grandfather clock downstairs strike ...eleven ...twelve ...thirteen ...Thirteen!

In this spirit, Oxford-trained classicist Lorna Robinson introduces readers to the wonderful, chimeric world of the Latin language&#x2015;and what better forum for this than the world of ancient Rome, where Latin flowered and expanded with the Roman Empire to become Europe's dominant language. Each chapter of <i>Cave Canem</i> explores the richness of Latin words and concepts through a different aspect of Roman life: from the language of home and garden, family and gods, to the classical Latin of the upper classes and of business, law, medicine, and the church; from the theater, literature, and the storytelling tradition to the everyday "vulgar Latin" of the street. A final chapter presents a miscellany of Latin phrases still very much in use around the world today. Beautifully illustrated with photos of Roman mosaics, <i>Cave Canem</i> brings to life the history and humor behind this world-shaping language.</p></p><p><p>Lorna Robinson studied classics at Oxford University. After she graduated, she went into teaching and created the Iris Project to promote the study of classics in state schools. Lorna currently runs Latin and Greek courses for the project in inner-city London schools, and plans to bring these courses to New York City.

These enemies of Israel are depicted on the red arrows upon the book cover image, and their mandate is clear: They have said, &#34;Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, That the name of Israel may be remembered no more.&#34; (Psalm 83:4). Psalm 83 predicts a climactic, concluding Arab-Israeli war that has eluded the discernment of today&#39;s top Bible scholars, and yet, the Middle East stage appears to be set for the fulfillment of this prophecy. While many of today&#39;s top Bible experts are predicting that Russia, Iran, Turkey, Libya, and several other countries are going to invade Israel according to the prophecy in Ezekiel 38, this timely book explains how Psalm 83 occurs prior. Discover how Israel defeats their ancient Arab enemies, and why Americans need to stand beside Israel in this coming war!

Alex had left for camp the day before, the bus departing from the Methodist church parking lot down the street. For Orly&#x2019;s dad this would be only an overnight trip, 725 miles down and back, because after he drove back to Houston he had to fly out to San Francisco two days later. He considered putting Orly on a direct flight to Brownsville, but thought they could use some father-son time, especially with Orly still wondering why he couldn&#x2019;t just stay in Houston. When they were done bringing all their bags out to the car, his dad told him to ride up front with him.<br><br> &#x201c;But Mom said I had to wait until I was a teenager.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t look like there&#x2019;s any room in the back, buddy.&#x201d; His dad had tossed the bags in the backseat instead of in the cargo space in the very back of the Suburban, where they usually stored the luggage. &#x201c;Plus it&#x2019;s a long ride. I could use the company.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She always said it was against the law for me to sit in the front and we might get in trouble.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and you already look thirteen to me.&#x201d; He mussed Orly&#x2019;s hair in that way he did when he meant to say it was a private joke, some caper between the two of them.<br><br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> Until that grayish Tuesday afternoon when he learned she died from one, Orly had never heard of an aneurysm. It was already weird, their dad picking him up after school two hours late when it should&#x2019;ve been Maribel picking him up on time. Alex was in the car and still sweaty from his basketball practice.<br><br> This was the day their mom was supposed to be moving into her townhouse.<br><br> <i>Oct. 4: Mom moving to Condo.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> There it was on the dry-erase board for everyone to see when they were at the refrigerator getting a cheese stick or filling their water bottles at the dispenser; she&#x2019;d even peeled off the magnetic stickers to Vincent&#x2019;s Doggy Daycare and the poison control center so they could see her note more clearly on the board. After the first or second week, though, the words had become more of a blur to him, seen but not read, recognized but no longer processed, no different from a reminder about an upcoming chimney sweep visit or Pepe&#x2019;s heartworm pills. It didn&#x2019;t help that she had run out of room to write &#x201c;townhouse&#x201d; and instead had settled for calling it a condo, when all along she had only called it a townhouse. There were probably similarities between townhouses and con�dos, sure, but in his mind he associated the word &#x201c;condo&#x201d; with the times they had gone as a family to the beach, which were fun and worth remembering and he knew this condo wasn&#x2019;t going to be either of those.<br><br> Her notes usually ended with two exclamation points, but in this case, because it wasn&#x2019;t exactly a happy day, not like a birth�day or anniversary, she had settled for underlining her words. Underlining wasn&#x2019;t the same as exclaiming; underlining meant this is important, don&#x2019;t forget because sooner or later this is com�ing around and you&#x2019;ll want to remember it; an exclamation point meant PAY ATTENTION because something&#x2019;s about to hap�pen, something you&#x2019;ll probably regret missing for a long time. And so yes, as soon as his mom had mentioned it that morning Orly remembered the date, of course, even if he tried to act like he thought it was next month or at the end of the summer, and anyway by then she&#x2019;d pulled up to the front of the car line and Mr. Dom�nguez, who happened to be on traffic-control duty that morning, opened Orly&#x2019;s door and said, &#x201c;�Buenos d�as, Orly!&#x201d; in his chipper voice and waited for him to exit, as did the other two dozen cars behind them. From there, his mom had rushed back to the house to wait for the movers, who were the ones who found her passed out next to the boxes she&#x2019;d been storing in the garage. Weeks earlier she had started taking the packing boxes out of the house so Alex and Orly wouldn&#x2019;t have to see what they already knew but didn&#x2019;t want to believe.<br><br> Their father had planned to wait until they were home before telling the boys anything, but with the summer heat and stop-and-go traffic and the tightness in his chest building like it would only be harder to say the longer it took to finally circle into their driveway and sit them down in the living room, he instead pulled into the first open parking lot he saw. He undid his seat belt so he could turn around and face them, then signaled for them to turn off their devices and remove their headphones, but told them not to open the doors because they weren&#x2019;t getting out.<br><br> Then why pull into Star Pizza? For as long as the boys could remember and way before their parents ever mentioned separat�ing, they used to come here as a family on those Friday nights when Maribel had the night off. It was the place they used to order the garlic bread from, with the deep-dish pizza that Alex used to get all over his shirt, the place that looks like an old house and has tiny restrooms, with the busboy who looks like their cousin Eloy, only older and with a gold tooth, where their parents sometimes let the kids sit outside on the patio while the grown-ups ate inside looking at their phones. Why that place?<br><br> &#x201c;I need to tell you something sad that happened today.&#x201d;<br><br> Orly&#x2019;s hand shot up. &#x201c;You got a new job and we&#x2019;re all moving somewhere else together?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, it has to do with our family, with Mom.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She changed her mind and isn&#x2019;t moving out?&#x201d; Alex said.<br><br> &#x201c;Why would that be sad?&#x201d; Orly asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just saying. Maybe he&#x2019;s the one moving out now.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But Mom said she had to be the one or else it might not happen.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Just let me finish, okay? Me first, then you.&#x201d; Their dad had twisted around in his seat but was still gripping the steering wheel with his left hand. He stared at both of them for a couple of sec�onds, as if he wanted to remember what their faces looked like in this moment before he said what he had to say. &#x201c;Your mom had an accident this morning.&#x201d;<br><br> Without knowing what exactly was coming next, Orly covered his ears and buried his face in his lap. He was humming so loud that it should&#x2019;ve blocked out the sound of his father&#x2019;s voice, but he heard enough to know the accident, as he suspected, was more than an accident. He heard it in his father&#x2019;s voice before he finished and the words made any sense.<br><br> After their father gave them the details of how she had died but they still had no idea what an aneurysm was, he told them it was a brain stroke, thinking this might stop them from asking so many questions, but of course it didn&#x2019;t because neither Orly nor Alex knew what a stroke was either. Even with his seat belt still pressing against his chest, Orly felt as if everything he had inside him, his heart and lungs and liver and kidneys and stomach, was slipping from his body, down his legs and onto the floor mat where he&#x2019;d just dropped his iPad.<br><br> Their father tried to explain that a stroke was like a heart attack but to her brain and the damage it did to her brain was what killed her. They knew heart attacks because their dad&#x2019;s mother had died of one years earlier, but a heart attack was something that hap�pened to old people and their mom was barely forty-one, which was old but not old-old, like grandma-old, not like heart-attack-old, even if hers was more like a brain attack. None of it made any sense. Their dad was seven years older. So why was she the one who got sick? Alex had stopped with all his questions and was star�ing out the window at something in the bushes. Then he started slowly bumping the side of his head against the glass over and over until his dad opened his door and went around the car to hold him in his arms, and a couple of minutes later did the same with Orly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even going against traffic, it took almost half an hour before they passed every Marshalls, Target, Walmart, Chili&#x2019;s, McDon�ald&#x2019;s, Academy, Subway, Home Depot, and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond it seemed there could be in the world. The drive down to Browns�ville usually took about six hours, but this time Orly knew it would feel a lot longer, more like seven or eight hours, maybe because on this trip he would be staying weeks and not days, or because his brother and his father wouldn&#x2019;t also be there with him. When he sat in the backseat he always had a movie or game to play on his iPad and basically, unless his mom or dad told him and Alex to look at some random cows in a pasture, he never had to deal with how utterly boring it was to look out the window.<br><br> They were only an hour from the house when his iPad dinged with a text.<br> &nbsp;<br> [Where r u?]<br> [In car w/ dad, just left HTX.] Orly responded.<br> [Tell Eduardo I said hi!]<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Alex says hi,&#x201d; Orly told his dad. He knew better than to say that just between them Alex liked to refer to their father by his first name. Or that he insisted on calling him Eduardo, the way he was addressed in Brownsville, and not Eddie, the way he was everywhere else.<br><br> [D says hi back. Says he heard there were no devices @ camp.]<br> [Fake News!]<br> [D says ur going 2 get into trouble 4 breaking the rules.]<br> [Tell Eduardo to chillax, it&#x2019;s a summer camp not a prison.]<br> [D says he should&#x2019;ve made both of us go to Brownsville.]<br> [AKA Camp BS (Boring Summer)]<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t long before what they saw out the tinted windows turned to miles and miles of dreary coastal plain, dull enough that Orly could nap for twenty minutes and after opening his eyes feel like they&#x2019;d been moving but were still in the same place. Before, when he used to sit behind his mom, he thought the boredom had to do with only being able to look out at the side of the road and not the road in front of them, but as it turned out, with the exception of spotting some roadkill, he really hadn&#x2019;t been miss�ing all that much. Still, he liked sitting up front like they were in a buddy movie, just the two of them traveling cross-country, even if it meant he had to talk more or listen to his dad&#x2019;s news station and couldn&#x2019;t just put on his headphones or play another round of <i>Clash Royale </i>on his iPad, which he had planned to do for most of the trip. Close to noon they stopped at a Whataburger for lunch and a pee break.<br><br> &#x201c;But what if I get bored and there&#x2019;s nothing to do?&#x201d;<br><br> They had already ordered at the counter and were waiting for one of the table servers to bring their meal out to them.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re taking your summer books and your iPad. But you should really be outside doing stuff.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Like what?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Lots of things. Taking chances and doing fun stuff, not just the things some camp director plans out for you and a bunch of other kids.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But doing what?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Whatever there is to do,&#x201d; his dad said. &#x201c;Your own ways to spend your time and have fun, different from mine. Give it a chance and you&#x2019;ll have a good time. Just wait and see.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Were you ever bored in the summer when you were growing up?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All the time, but then I found things to do. You&#x2019;ll have fun in Brownsville and get to do things on your own. You&#x2019;ll see how dif�ferent it is down there and how good you and your brother have it where you live and the schools you go to, stuff I never had grow�ing up. It&#x2019;s just three weeks to try something new. Your Nina will take good care of you and keep you safe.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What if I hate it or if she&#x2019;s mean?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Has she been mean to you before when we&#x2019;ve gone to visit or she&#x2019;s come to see us in Houston?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, but maybe she&#x2019;ll get tired of me being there.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I doubt it&#x2014;she&#x2019;s been begging me for years for you to go stay with her.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She looks like she could be mean.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Because she&#x2019;s older?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe.&#x201d; He took a sip of his soda.<br><br> &#x201c;You should&#x2019;ve seen her when she was young.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What was she like?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve only seen pictures, but everybody used to say she was even prettier. I heard that one time she was in the parade and a photog�rapher from San Antonio walked the whole route, like more than a mile, just to give her his phone number and ask if she wanted to be a model.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wait, seriously, she was a model?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not really. She was still in high school and her parents didn&#x2019;t let her.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What about after she graduated?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I guess she changed her mind.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How come she never got married?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Who knows? It just didn&#x2019;t work out that way. Not everybody&#x2019;s supposed to be married.&#x201d;<br><br> When the food showed up there was some confusion about who had ordered which cheeseburger. This was actually the first time Orly had ordered something off the regular menu, which he did only because his dad had invited him to sit up front in the Sub�urban with him and Orly wanted him to think he was older. His dad had even let him get a soft drink, an orange Fanta, something his mom never let him do.<br> &nbsp;<br> The most frustrating part for Orly was not knowing what hap�pened to her, not having a way to understand why someone would have an aneurysm. Even later that same day, in his room at home, he couldn&#x2019;t immediately look it up on his laptop because he didn&#x2019;t know how to spell the word, which in a stupid way made the whole thing that much worse, his mother dying of something he didn&#x2019;t know how to google.<br><br> &#x201c;The doctor said nobody knows why this happened now. Some�times it happens this way with aneurysms.&#x201d; They were eating din�ner at the time they were usually already in bed. Their father had reheated the chicken and pasta soup Maribel had left for them.<br><br> &#x201c;No warning at all?&#x201d; Orly said.<br><br> &#x201c;Sometimes, or the person feels like something is wrong but keeps it to himself until it&#x2019;s too late.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Herself,&#x201d; Alex said.<br><br> &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; his father said. &#x201c;Herself.&#x201d;<br><br> The doctors did all they could to try to save her. At least she hadn&#x2019;t suffered long. This last part was meant to make them feel a little less sad. And of course Orly wouldn&#x2019;t have wanted her to suffer, but he also wasn&#x2019;t sure about her leaving so suddenly, about his finding out when it was already too late, about having to wait until after school because his father needed time to figure out all the things he needed to do next, the arrangements with the funeral home, the death certificate, phone calls to family and certain friends, to her law firm, to his office, before the next thing to do was tell the boys what had happened to their mom.</p><h2>Truth for Today Commentary: Life of Christ, 2 A Supplement</h2><p>Every Christian should thrill at the reading of the Gospel Accounts.

Original.</p><p>Earle Leonard Nelson may well have been America's first serial killer. In the winter of 1926, he began a string of murders that spanned the U.S. and Canada, horrifying and confounding both the public and the police. <i>Bestial</i> tells the story of Nelson's life--from his bizarre childhood to his ignoble end--sparing no graphic detail in the process. If there is an answer to the question of why this man murdered, it is in this book somewhere. Everything about Nelson seems bizarre, from his family to his eating habits to his religious obsessions. But strangest of all was his compulsion to kill--for no imaginable reason. He killed women of all ages, from all walks of life, seemingly with no remorse.<p> <i>Bestial</i> reads like fast-paced fiction, complete with action, plot twists, suspense, and eerie foreshadowing. The book is compelling and elegantly written, and the story provides chilling insights into the motivations of a man who killed for killing's sake. <i>--Lisa Higgins</i></p>FROM SOCIAL OUTCAST TO NECROPHILE AND MURDERER -- HIS APPALLING CRIMES STUNNED AN ERA<p>San Francisco, the 1920s. In an age when nightmares were relegated to the fiction of Edgar Allan Poe and distant tales of the Whitechapel murders, a real-life monster terrorized America. His acts of butchery have proved him one of history's fiercest madmen.</p><p>As an infant, Earle Leonard Nelson possessed the power to unsettle his elders. As a child he was unnaturally obsessed with the Bible; before he reached puberty, he had an insatiable, aberrant sex drive. By his teens, even Earle's own family had reason to fear him. But no one in the bone-chilling winter of 1926 could have predicted that his degeneracy would erupt in a sixteen-month frenzy of savage rape, barbaric murder, and unimaginable defilement -- deeds that would become the hallmarks of one of the most notorious fiends of the twentieth century, whose blood-lust would not be equaled until the likes of Henry Lee Lucas, John Wayne Gacy, and Jeffrey Dahmer.</p><p>Drawing on the "gruesome, awesome, compelling reporting" (Ann Rule) that is his trademark, Harold Schechter takes a dark journey into the mind of an unrepentant sadist -- and brilliantly lays bare the myth of innocence that shrouded a bygone era.</p></p><h2>Arthur&#39;s Christmas: An Arthur Adventure (Arthur Adventures)</h2><p>Christmas is only days away and Arthur can&#39;t find the perfect gift to give Santa! Finally, he has an idea and with a little help from his sister, Christmas will be a success!</p><p>Marc Brown, who was born in Erie, Pennsylvania in 1946, received great encouragement and support from his grandmother and uncle. Inspired by the books of Maurice Sendak, Brown decided to pursue his ambition of becoming an illustrator. After receiving a B.F.A. in painting from the Cleveland Institute of Art, he worked as a TV art director, a professor of mechanical drawing, and a freelance illustrator, before becoming a writer. In his books, he addresses the fears and problems which children face and events like friendship, family, school and pets. For his illustrations, Brown uses pencil with watercolor on a variety of papers to achieve different visual effects. The &#34;Arthur&#34; series, about the everyday adventures of a lovable aardvark, began in 1976 and continues to this day with 25 titles published. Brown has also created other series such as the &#34;Rhymes&#34; series, and the nonfiction &#34;Dinosaur&#34; series, which conveys messages of do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. These series, like the stories of Arthur, hold the attention of young children while transporting their imaginations on magical journeys.<b>Praise for other <i>Arthur</i> books:</b><strong>Arthur's Baby <br></strong>"Sure-fire appeal for the primary grade set, as well as Arthur addicts of all ages." <br>--School Library Journal, starred review<br><br><strong>Arthur's Birthday:<br></strong>"Arthur's warm, loving family and his diplomatic approach to problem solving strike just the right note * positive and believable." <br>--School Library Journal<br><br><strong>Arthur's New Puppy:<br></strong>"Brown's sweet, colorful illustrations sparkle with humor and child appeal, and his message comes through loud and clear." <br>--Booklist<br><br><strong>Arthur's Family Vacation:<br></strong>"Brown's 17th Arthur adventure is right on target.

At twenty, Hanna escaped from East to West Germany. But the price of freedom--leaving behind her parents, eight siblings, and family home--was heartbreaking. Uprooted, Hanna eventually moved to America, where she settled down with her husband and had children of her own. Growing up near Washington, D.C., Hanna&#39;s daughter, Nina Willner became the first female Army Intelligence Officer to lead sensitive intelligence operations in East Berlin at the height of the Cold War. Though only a few miles separated American Nina and her German relatives--grandmother Oma, Aunt Heidi, and cousin, Cordula, a member of the East German Olympic training team--a bitter political war kept them apart. In Forty Autumns, Nina recounts her family&#39;s story--five ordinary lives buffeted by circumstances beyond their control. She takes us deep into the tumultuous and terrifying world of East Germany under Communist rule, revealing both the cruel reality her relatives endured and her own experiences as an intelligence officer, running secret operations behind the Berlin Wall that put her life at risk. A personal look at a tenuous era that divided a city and a nation, and continues to haunt us, Forty Autumns is an intimate and beautifully written story of courage, resilience, and love--of five women whose spirits could not be broken, and who fought to preserve what matters most: family.</p><p><p>Growing up in a provincial village outside of Berlin, Hanna was encouraged by her schoolteacher father to follow her dreams.

Continuing the practical, insightful discoveries from the best-selling first volume of Her Name Is Woman, Gien Karssen adds the stories of twenty-five more women from the pages of Scripture in Her Name Is Woman, Book 2. Deborah, Delilah, Ruth, Bathsheba, Jezebel, Mary Magdelene-these and many others become surprisingly real and relevant as you step closer to their hearts and lives. Some were successful and some failed-just like women today. What caused their successes, heartaches, joys, and failures? This volume explores the practical truth surrounding each of these biblical women. Both volumes of Her Name Is Woman are for &#x201c;every woman who seeks the deeper meaning of her existence,&#x201d; writes Karssen. Each of the forty nine cameos contained in the two volumes will help you understand and fulfill your deepest desires and ideals.</p><h2>The Inferno of Dante Alighieri</h2><p>Translated for the common reader, this new version of the classic literary epic follows the author and his guide, Virgil, on their immortal journey through the nine circles of hell in search of divine justice. Original.</p><p>Ciaran Carson was born in 1948 in Belfast where he still lives. He has been awarded the Irish Times Literature Prize, the T.S. Eliot Prize and the Yorkshire Post Prize.While news-making controversy rages over the mounting mound of Bible translations, yet another Dante's <i>Inferno</i> in English doesn't much bother anyone. Nor should it in the case of Ulster poet Carson's version. Comparison with dual-language editions confirms it is faithful to the original, only with a slight Scots-Irish accent (e.g., in using <i>girn</i> instead of<i> snarl</i>), which may require occasional recourse to a collegiate dictionary. Writing in Dante's form, terza rima, necessarily with plenty of off rhymes (English isn't rhyme-rich like Italian), Carson nicely manages the form's propulsive thrust; when Virgil wants Dante to get a move on in this version, we share his urgency. Carson says that as he got deeper into the work, he took a lot of walks around Belfast. Perhaps the rhythm of his pace infected that of his verse. At any rate, this is brisk reading, and the journey from the dark wood through Hell's nine circles to Satan's waist and beyond has seldom been so bracing. An excellent choice for first acquaintance with a perpetually fascinating classic. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The benefits are considerable: dams deliver hydropower, provide reliable irrigation water, protect people and farmland against flooding, and produce hydroelectricity in a nation with a seeimingly insatiable appetite for energy. As hydropower responds to a larger share of energy demand, dams may also help to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, welcome news in a country where air and water pollution have become dire and greenhouse gas emissions are the highest in the world. <br><br>Yet the advantages of dams come at a high cost for river ecosystems and for the social and economic well-being of local people, who face displacement and farmland loss. This book examines the array of water-management decisions faced by Chinese leaders and their consequences for local communities. Focusing on the southwestern province of Yunnan&#x2015;a major hub for hydropower development in China&#x2015;which encompasses one of the world's most biodiverse temperate ecosystems and one of China's most ethnically and culturally rich regions, Bryan Tilt takes the reader from the halls of decision-making power in Beijing to Yunnan's rural villages. In the process, he examines the contrasting values of government agencies, hydropower corporations, NGOs, and local communities and explores how these values are linked to longstanding cultural norms about what is right, proper, and just. He also considers the various strategies these groups use to influence water-resource policy, including advocacy, petitioning, and public protest. Drawing on a decade of research, he offers his insights on whether the world's most populous nation will adopt greater transparency, increased scientific collaboration, and broader public participation as it continues to grow economically.</p><p><i>Dams and Development in China</i> examines the water-management decisions faced by Chinese leaders and their consequences for local communities.

The adventure begins when a girl explorer-turned-monster recognizes Runt as family. Not knowing what this means, Runt sets out to discover from where the creature came and what this means about his long-lost relations. His quest is constantly waylaid by an ancient feud between sirens and mermaids, a fashion show, and a hostile takeover of his school. After a promising debut, this title pales a bit in comparison; a fashion show doesn't stir quite the same drama as zombies and dragons. The pacing is a bit slow and drags in the middle, but Grau's characters are likable and entertaining. Sutphin is back and delivers soundly with fantastic illustrations of EOs (that's Evil Overlords for the uninitiated) and enamored gorillas.

Although he knew Percy (1916-90) personally in his final years, Samway maintains a scholarly distance in this meticulously researched biography. It does not supplant Jay Tolson&#39;s more passionate 1992 assessment, but offers a valuable additional perspective.Samway, who edited Signposts in a Strange Land, Percy's posthumously published essays, successfully triangulates the major forces unifying Percy's life (191690): a complex mix of Catholic faith, existential angst, and scientific method. Percy spent his childhood in Greenville, Miss., raised by his uncle, the poet Will Percy, after the suicide of both parents. He began writing early, as a gossip columnist for his high school newspaper, but later turned to medicine, seeking a scientific discipline to bring order to his chaotic life. Stricken with tuberculosis while serving a residency at New York's Bellevue hospital, Percy spent several years recovering in a sanitarium. There he began reading philosophy and identified the central irony in his life: Science, despite unraveling the workings of the human body and the universe, ultimately knows nothing about the mystery of human existence, ``what it is like to be a man living in the world who must die.'' To explore that mystery Percy turned to fiction, which he considered a means of applying the scientific method to the study of the self. Though best known for novels of alienation, including his 1962 National Book Awardwinning The Moviegoer, Percy felt his essays on semiotics (the study of ``why people talk and animals don't,'' as he joked to longtime friend Shelby Foote) were his most important work. Despite considerable efforts to explain them, Percy's difficult language theories here remain obtuse. Samway, a Jesuit and close friend of Percy's, is more adept at illuminating the writer's midlife conversion to Catholicism, insightfully tracing the influence of this sustaining religious faith on his fiction--a connection Percy felt too few readers made. He believed The Moviegoer was misunderstood as ``a novel of despair, rather than a novel about despair but with hope.'' Such crucial distinctions make this an essential critical companion to Percy's work, though the respectful tone mutes Percy's darker side--the malevolent irony and wicked satire so integral to his novels.

"It is an undeniable fact that the whole world is talking about Marpingen," wrote one sympathetic commentator. "Marpingen has become the center of events that have shaken the world," suggested another.<br><br>Tens of thousands of pilgrims flocked to the town, prompting numerous claims of miraculous cures -- as well as military intervention, the dispatch of an undercover detective, parliamentary debate, and a dramatic trial.<br><br>Pondering what had happened from another perspective was a man on whom the drama placed a heavy burden. "The events are so tremendous," wrote a Marpingen parish priest, "that a true account of them would already fill a book."<br><br>Blackbourn, a leading historian of modem Germany, vividly portrays the Catholic world of the Bismarckian era through a detailed exploration of the changing social, economic, and community structures that formed its matrix, and provides a sensitive account of popular religious beliefs. Ranging widely across the fields of social, cultural, and political history, he powerfully evokes the crisis-laden atmosphere of the 1870s, revealing the subtle interplay between politics and religion, the changing nature of the family itself, and the ferment of ideas that fueled the great debate over "modernity." And in a final chapter, he looks ahead to the renewed apparitions of the Virgin in twentieth-century Marpingen against the background of war, Nazism, and the Cold War.A remarkable piece of historical detective work by an important scholar.</p><p>David Blackbourn was born in Lincolnshire, England, in 1949, and studied history at Cambridge University, where he was Research Fellow of Jesus College from 1973 to 1976. He taught at London University from 1976 to 1992, before moving to Harvard, where he is Professor of History and Senior Associate of the Center for European Studies. His work has appeared in six languages, and he is the author of Class, Religion, and Local Politics in Wilhelmine Germany (1980), The Peculiarities of German History (with Geoff Eley, 1984), and Populists and Patricians (1987), and co-editor (with Richard Evans) of The German Bourgeoisie (1991). He lives with his wife and two children in Lexington, Massachusetts.An absorbing, challenging work of ``bottom-up'' history that gives a voice to the unlettered and the disempowered. Blackbourn (History/Harvard) transforms an apparently minor historical curiosity, an instance at best of religious pathology, into a fascinating, surprising, and moving picture of cultural turmoil in the new German nation-state. The event in question is the alleged visitation of the Virgin Mary to three schoolchildren in the remote Rhineland village of Marpingen in 1876, and the response thereto. With sure control of his material and an archaeologist's reconstructive gift, Blackbourn deftly reveals the Marpingen events as a tangled but telling intersection of multiple cultural currents: religious strife, both interdenominational and between competing tendencies in the Catholic hierarchy itself; local communal rivalry; class tensions; grassroots populist activism; Bismarck's ongoing Kulturkampf (``cultural war'') against the Catholic Church; and the upheavals in work and family life provoked by the confrontation of a traditional rural culture with the very different rhythms of a 19th-century industrial state. Blackbourn brushes against the grain of readers' expectations: He encourages us to regard the widespread popular support of the visionaries not as superstitious medieval credulity but as a sophisticated mobilization of deep-rooted cultural resources by a community beset by social dislocation. Conversely, the ``progressive'' modernizing forces of state authority, whose response to the apparitions varied from patrician condescension to outright contempt or suspicion, stand revealed as at least as self- righteous and blinkered (by a faith in secular rationality often as unyielding as religious dogma) as the peasants they undertook to control. The Church itself is riven and ambivalent, its sponsorship of the cult of the Madonna at odds with the increasingly authoritarian bent of the 19th-century Vatican. This dense, authoritative book demands and deserves an attentive reading and offers rewards few recent historical narratives can match. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Then she discovered what she calls "aerobic breathing" and claims she started burning off inches. Fitness and weight-loss experts would argue that aerobic <i>exercise</i>--not just <i>breathing</i>--is what burns fat, but Childers insists the method has worked for her and her clients.<p> <i>Be a Loser</i> presents Childers's own story about trying to lose weight and her theory about weight loss--that oxygen is "the non-medical miracle" and that learning how to breathe "aerobically" is her secret for weight loss. She teaches her breathing technique and a series of simple stretches and nonstrenuous calisthenic exercises that she claims "tone muscle."</p>Greer Childers, fifty-four and a mother of three, developed the BodyFlex program and went from a size 16 to a size 4.

The role of a sports-team leader is fascinating, complex, and tough. Fantasy football leagues may convince us that success is all about buying players and selecting a team. In reality, it is about creating winning environments&#x2014;recruiting, developing, and nurturing talent, effectively communicating a shared vision with a diverse collection of individuals, delivering on enormous expectations from a range of stakeholders, overcoming significant challenges, handling pressure, and staying focused throughout: a set of challenges familiar to leaders in all sectors.</p><p><b>Damian Hughes</b> combines his practical and academic background within sport, organization and change psychology to work as a trusted adviser to business, education and sporting elite, specializing in the creation of high-performance cultures.</p><h2>Presidential Lottery: The Reckless Gamble in Our Electoral System</h2><p>Examines the American system for electing a President and Vice-President, its dangers, and possible methods of improvement</p><p><b>James A.

Born into poverty, she turned herself from an ugly duckling into a beautiful swan, and in the process became the most celebrated diva of the 20th century. She breathed life, drama, and passion into an art form that had hitherto remained the preserve of an intellectual elite, and was single-handedly responsible for turning opera from an arts-page sideshow to front-page news. Her bust-ups with the New York Met and her disastrous love life--culminating in a tragic obsession with Aristotle Onassis--were as enthralling as her voice, and there was a depressing inevitability about her mysterious, early death in 1977 at the age of 54. <p> It's hardly surprising, then, that there have been any number of books written about Callas. Most have been little more than well-researched clippings jobs. Callas spent nearly 30 years in the public eye, and there is any amount of material about her on public record. What separates Stelios Galatopoulos from the rest of her biographers is the wealth of previously unpublished material from which he draws. He is stronger than most on Callas's early years--particularly the German occupation of Greece during the Second World War--which is a period many writers try to ignore, as Callas was accused by many Greek patriots of having been a traitor to her country by continuing to perform for the Nazis in the Athens opera house. Galatopoulos is quick to absolve her of any charges of collaboration. This is probably a correct assessment, though he falls short of labeling Callas and her mother as the ruthless careerists and opportunists they undoubtedly were. </p><p> Herein lie both the strength and weakness of the book. Galatopoulos was a close personal friend of Callas; as such he was privy to her most private thoughts and he offers us some fascinating new insights into her husband, Giovanni Meneghini; her lover Aristotle Onassis; and her mother. What he doesn't always do, though, is maintain a critical eye. Whenever he deals with anything controversial, he is happy to give Callas the benefit of the doubt. But all this is really a minor quibble. Overall, Galatopoulos does a superb job in re-creating the opera world of the 1940s through to the 1970s and he excels in his assessment of Callas's artistic achievements. <i>Maria Callas: Sacred Monster</i> may not be the final word on the diva, but it's as close as it comes. <i>--John Crace</i></p><b>Stelios Galatopoulos</b> has contributed to many music journals, including <i>Music and Musicians, Records and Recordings,</i> and <i>Lirica nel Mondo</i> (Italy).

His followers have long hungered for a full portrait of the man whose wisdom touched so many, but until now no book has been published by or about this extraordinary individual. <br><br>David Chadwick, who studied with Suzuki at the San Francisco Zen Center from 1966 until Suzuki's death in 1971, has interviewed his mentor's family, friends, and disciples and was granted full access to Japanese and American archives. <i>Crooked Cucumber</i> begins with Suzuki's earliest days in Japan, where his teacher nicknamed him "Crooked Cucumber," claiming Suzuki was too absent-minded and dim-witted to ever become a successful priest. Chadwick follows Suzuki through his new life in San Francisco amid the cultural upheaval of the '60s, creating a context for his refreshing and profound teaching. Brief, illuminating chapters, with previously unpublished lecture quotes, convey the down-to-earth message of a man who continues to transform countless lives.</p><p><i>"He's big Suzuki, I'm little Suzuki."</i><p> In the literary world, Shunryu Suzuki has always played second fiddle to D.T. Suzuki. With David Chadwick's biography of this extraordinary man, Shunryu Suzuki will take his rightful place as one of the progenitors of American Buddhism. Chadwick, a long-time student of Suzuki's, takes us back to Suzuki's childhood, his entry into monastic life at age 13, subsequent trials with his ornery master and in the notoriously strict Eiheiji Monastery, as well as life as a houseboy with a British tutor to the Chinese emperor, marital tragedies, and the political minefield of World War II while he served as abbot of his own temple. The overarching theme of Suzuki's teaching is practice--in a community setting--and when he takes over a temple of aging Japanese Americans in San Francisco, his practice begins to attract younger Americans. The second half of <i>Crooked Cucumber</i> relates the phenomenal growth of the San Francisco Zen Center and becomes a biography of the growing community and its members, inasmuch as the center was Suzuki's life. A monk who was thought to be as useless as a crooked cucumber, under the pen of Chadwick turns out to be a brilliant, witty, tireless patriarch of American Zen. <i>--Brian Bruya</i></p>Shunryu Suzuki is known to countless readers as the author of the modern spiritual classic, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind. This most influential teacher comes vividly to life in Crooked Cucumber, the first full biography of any Zen master to be published in the West. To make up his intimate and engrossing narrative, David Chadwick draws on Suzuki's own words and the memories of his students, friends, and family.<p>Interspersed with previously unpublished passages from Suzuki's talks and correspondence, Crooked Cucumber evokes a down-to-earth life of the spirit that goes beyond religion to reveal what it means to be fully human. Retracing this man's journey, readers will find more of the warm-hearted guidance that so many have already found in Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind. Along with Suzuki we can find a way to "practice with mountains, trees, and stones ... and to find ourselves in this big world".</p></p><h2>Watercolour Painting: Step-By-Step</h2><p>&#34;Originally published in 2001 as Working with watercolour&#34;--T.p. verso.</p><p>Jackie Barrass is a watercolor artist whose work can be seen at the annual exhibitions by the Society of Women Artists in London.

The introduction shows the basic foundations of watercolour painting followed by tutorials, examples, tips and techniques covering landscapes and flower painting. I really enjoyed this colourful book and would not hesitate to recommend it to novice watercolour painters. The seven included artists have different styles and demonstrate their techniques. This book is well-illustrated with easy to follow instructions such as painting skies. There are fourteen demonstrations altogether amongst a wealth of information. This 144 page book includes over 300 photographs.-KarenPlatt.co.uk The seven authors of this book bring together a wealth of experience and useful help to anyone who wants to discover the delights of watercolour paints. They show us how to lay transparent and luminous washes, soft delicate areas of colour creating mood and atmosphere though to dramatic and bold sweeps of colour. Beginning with basic advice on choosing materials, through to some practical and useful help with colour, tone and composition it goes on to more detailed specifics of working with this medium, and the more advanced techniques that can be used to produce some wonderful and ethereal effects. Each are accompanied by many illustrations from each artist explaining just how the effects were created. We are shown in easy and clear to follow stages how to create wonderful soft skies, realistic trees, water and reflection to buildings in the landscape and lifelike flowers. Having been shown expert tips and illustration on techniques and skills used to create these images we are given useful demonstrations on each to practice them for ourselves. A practical an informative book full of expert tips and advice that will aid all watercolour artists to enjoy the delights of working with this fabulous medium,whether they are complete beginners or more experienced artist.-JeannieZelos.com Each of these step-by-step books on drawing, watercolour and acrylics draws on the experience of experts of the medium. There are general chapters, which serve as a basis from which to work up, but specific topics are allocated to one of the many experts. This demonstrates distinctions in style and explains the techniques behind them. It's rare to find guides that successfully cater to so many levels of ability. The opening chapters are dedicated to the beginner, with plenty of focus on mixing colour. However, these books are not just for the uninitiated - all three hold plenty of precious knowledge nuggets for even the most seasoned artists: acrylic texture and lighting in watercolour are both exacting matters and not for the fair-weather painter. All three volumes share more or less the same format; pages littered with plenty of pictures and short bursts of text, so that readers don't have to wade through excessive information in order to get to the point. The study topics are traditional, with nature and animals featuring almost exclusively, and you can't help thinking that each volume could benefit from branching out, even if for just one chapter, into something a little less conventional. Although three entirely separate books, and more than valid on their own, there is something attractive about linking them as a comprehensive learning experience, with disciplines from three different areas serving to complement each other.-Artists &amp; Illustrators Search Press is renowned for its high quality, great value books, and it lives up to its reputation with its new series of step-by-step guides covering key topics in drawing and painting. Each book is written by a range of well-respected artists, thus providing varied approaches to each topic or medium. Some readers might note that these titles draw together elements from the Leisure Arts series. They do not, however, feel like patchwork texts, and unless you already have the full set of the earlier smaller works, these compilations provide fantastic value for money. The books all have a similar structure, starting with chapters covering the basics of the topic, thereby making them very accessible for beginners. For example, in Drawing Step-by-Step, Richard Box introduces the subject by looking at fundamental drawing techniques and a wide range of suitable media, interspersed with step-by-step demonstrations; whilst in the Watercolour Painting title, there is an exploration of techniques, media, composition, colour and tone. Following these introductory sections, various experts provide instruction on their specialist topics, developing skills, and providing further inspiration. The Acrylic Painting and Drawing books are constructed with defined chapters, whilst the Watercolour Painting book, created by seven artists, appears more fluid, concealing any sense of it being a compilation of other texts. In the Acrylic Painting guide, for instance, David Hyde and Carole Massey follow on from Wendy Jelbert's introduction, which demonstrates the flexibility of the medium, providing specific guidance on their specialist subjects; landscape and flower painting respectively. Wendy then completes the book by sharing a range of her exciting ideas for creating texture. In the book on drawing, Box's introductory section is followed by Ronald Swanwick on drawing landscapes; Denis John Naylor on trees; Sally Michel on pets; and finally Carole Massey on water-soluble pencils. Each book contains at least ten full step-by-step demonstrations, with panels detailing materials. The wide range of subjects and approaches allows readers to move on to more advanced techniques, making the books appealing to artists of all levels.

He was born in Warsaw, Poland, on February 27, 1935. He began drawing at the age of three and, unlike many children, never stopped. The Warsaw blitz occurred when he was four years old, and the Shulevitz family fled. For eight years they were wanderers, arriving, eventually, in Paris in 1947. There Shulevitz developed an enthusiasm for French comic books, and soon he and a friend started making their own. At thirteen, Shulevitz won first prize in an all-elementary-school drawing competition in Paris's 20th district. </p><p>In 1949, the family moved to Israel, where Shulevitz worked a variety of jobs: an apprentice at a rubber-stamp shop, a carpenter, and a dog-license clerk at Tel Aviv City Hall.

As the horses moved goods from one location to another they also carried moving advertisements for attracting customers along their routes.Today you can still see these magnificent horses pulling beautiful wagons that are also moving billboards, but usually during parades or as an exhibition at festivals and horse shows.

In spite of their differences, the five remain bonded by their shared experience and devotion to their candidate.<br><br>For Doggie, who worked the campaign trail with Wesley, Jansen's election is a personal victory: a job in the White House, proof to her Republican father that she was right to support Jansen, and the rise of an intelligent, clear-headed leader with her same ideals. But the triumph is short-lived: Jansen's pregnant wife is assassinated on election night, and the alleged mastermind behind the shooting is none other than Doggie's own father. <br><br>When Jansen ascends to the White House, he is a changed man, determined to end gun violence by any means necessary. Rights are taken away as quickly as weapons. International travel becomes impossible. Checkpoints and roadblocks destroy infrastructure. The media is censored. Militias declare civil war on the government. The country is in chaos, and Jansen's former friends each find themselves fighting a very different battle, for themselves, their rights, their country . . . and, in Doggie's case, the life of her father, who just may be innocent.</p><p><b>Jussi Adler-Olsen </b>is Denmark's #1 crime writer and a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author.

In Doggie's case the ending couldn't have been worse.<br><br> It all began with Governor Jansen's office sending Virginia's biggest local television station a suggestion for a new quiz show, plus the capital to get it off the ground.<br><br> It was to be a geographical quiz where everyone who could correctly name China's most populous city was invited to participate. The TV station went for the idea.<br><br> After the initial elimination round, only forty-eight participants were left, and among them-quite sensationally-was a fourteen-year-old girl. The excitement rose for four weeks: Both the sponsor, Leatherman Auto Tires, and Governor Jansen's campaign office wanted to get their money's worth.<br><br> The first programs were broadcast in the afternoon, but the show quickly found its way into prime time. A good three-quarters of Virginians followed the event on their TV screens. This was a new viewer record.<br><br> Throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia, people bet on the outcome. Each had his or her favorite. But most, by far, backed the girl with the dimples, who was also the youngest contestant: Dorothy Curtis, also known as Doggie.<br><br> Three weeks and three episodes later, Virginia's TV audience finally got their three winners-and what winners they were! Governor Jansen beamed like a Hollywood star, the host had his wages doubled, and the newspapers went crazy. With the exception of a blonde with silicone breasts and full hips who lost out in the last round (but instead got her own talk show on which to display her attributes), the winners couldn't have been more popular.<br><br> First prize went to Rosalie Lee, a big African-American woman from New York who happened to be in Virginia for the first time, visiting her sister Josefine. Rosalie was a showpiece of a woman, with pearly teeth, roaring laughter, and winks to the audience, and few could match her talent of using so much time to answer a question that the audience was about to go crazy.<br><br> Only one point behind her came T. Perkins, a pale-faced, practically albino sheriff, who came from one of the smallest counties in the northwestern part of the state. A man who, in his youth, had been one of the nation's best dart players. And finally, in an impressive third place came Doggie Curtis, the girl with the dimples. What a triumph! The winners couldn't have been more different, and everyone involved with the show was pleased. How could any part of the population feel overlooked with those three? It simply wasn't possible.<br><br> The lucky winners couldn't believe it when they heard their prize being announced live on the show. Along with the graduated cash jackpots came nothing less than a trip to the other side of the world for the three of them.<br><br> For Doggie especially, it was all unreal and incredible. They were to travel to China with Governor Bruce Jansen, his staff, and an official Chinese delegation. They'd be entering a closed world, and everything would be paid for.<br><br> It sounded like a fairy tale.<br><br> Doggie's father was proud about his daughter being so bright, but not about her prize. He was a right-wing Republican and hated Bruce Jansen, who was "old money" and a Democrat besides.<br><br> "Jansen? That swine?" he yelled at her. "You don't plan to participate in a PR stunt like that, advancing the ambitions of that fucking untrustworthy Democrat, do you?!" He forbid her going, and Doggie's mother was forced to use all her powers of persuasion to make him change his mind.<br><br> As fate would have it, this was the last time Doggie heard them quarrel. Her parents were divorced just five months later, a divorce that descended into a fight over money and custody of their child. Doggie ended up being installed in her mother's house with her mother's maiden name.<br><br> In a way her father was right. It was all a PR stunt, but so what? Governor Jansen was a clever man. He'd taken three ordinary people and made them everybody's darlings, and via them, invited Virginia's entire population of seven million souls along to a far-off, enigmatic land. It was practically the only thing folks talked and read about. School newspapers, ladies' magazines, and even Doggie's father's boring hotel business newsletter wrote about it. And everyone wanted to talk with Doggie. She'd been approached by twenty-one of Virginia's thirty-four newspapers, either for interviews or to publish the last month's entries in her diary.<br><br> It was quite an achievement: Bruce Jansen had embraced the entire population all at once, and vice versa. He may have been calculating, but a swine he was not. He was quite fantastic, actually.<br><br> Doggie's heart was pounding as she bid her mother farewell and ascended the portable stairway to the huge airplane, glittering in the sunshine. She'd flown at least twenty times within the States, plus to Mexico and Puerto Rico, but never in a plane that size. It was a little frightening.<br><br> When she reached her seat, Sheriff T. Perkins was already in the next seat by the window, looking sleepy and absentmindedly cleaning his fingernails with the point of a gilded dart. Governor Jansen's wife, Caroll Jansen, came over and patted her on the cheek. "You're a clever girl, Doggie," she said. "It was wonderful, you winning third place. Just magnificent. I think we're going to have a fine time together, we two." She nodded graciously to a few of the passengers and sat down a couple of rows forward, between her husband and his indispensable right hand, Thomas Sunderland.<br><br> Then Rosalie Lee came blustering down the aisle. She gave everyone a hearty greeting and planted herself next to Doggie, her bulk flowing over onto Doggie's seat. She immediately emptied a giant paper bag of Coca-Cola cans, crackers, chips, and a great variety of candy bars and began offering goodies to all her neighbors. It had been like that in the TV studio, too. No one in Rosalie Lee's company was going to go hungry if she had anything to say about it.<br><br> Chewing away on her portable feast, she entertained Doggie with talk of New York, her little apartment in the Bronx, and her three wonderful sons, finishing with peals of laughter as she described how she'd kicked her loser of a husband out of her home, ass first.<br><br> Rosalie's unrestrained laughter woke Sheriff T. Perkins up a bit, and he looked around in bewilderment. He was pretty easygoing-slept now and then and didn't say much. He'd clearly been the most knowledgeable of the three quiz winners, but even though Rosalie Lee had sometimes seemed slow-witted, appearances were deceptive. Her brain was capable of changing gears suddenly and leaving everyone in the dust, and that was how she wound up winning the contest.<br><br> A couple of hours later, a young man who'd been sleeping since takeoff leaned his head towards the row of prizewinners in front of him. "Wesley Barefoot." He presented himself with luminous teeth. "Well, looks like we're going to be together the next couple of weeks. Maybe you know my mother-she's Governor Jansen's secretary." The three shook their heads politely.<br><br> "Congratulations, by the way," he continued. "I watched all the episodes, just like everybody else. You were all brilliant!"<br><br> They smiled obligingly-just the cue the man needed to launch into his life story. He was studying law and loved politics and British rock bands. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.<br><br> Doggie thought he was nice and smelled good.<br><br> Bruce Jansen took one female prizewinner under each arm as they walked towards the welcoming deputation of photographers, cameramen, and journalists in Beijing's airport. The weather was cold and gray, and everyone was talking at once. After the obligatory questions from the Chinese press, the governor turned to face the international press that was standing behind a row of blue-clad Chinese soldiers.<br><br> Doggie quickly noticed one of the journalists, a very little man with intense, dark eyes and a receding hairline. A man who was obviously receiving more attention than the others and got all his questions answered, one after the other. When the interview was over, the governor and his wife disappeared in a black limousine, along with two Chinese officials. The rest of his staff followed in another official car, and the crowd of journalists began breaking up. Apparently the diminutive, dark-eyed journalist was the only one who seemed interested in the rest of Jansen's party. He waved to his photographer and made straight for the little group.<br><br> "Hey, my name's John Bugatti," he said with a hoarse voice, and cleared his throat. "I work for NBC. I'm supposed to follow along with you and Jansen on the whole tour, so I thought I'd say hello." Close up, Doggie could see he had more freckles than she'd ever seen. An irresistible little guy. She was really enjoying this trip-her father's objections had been completely unfounded.<br><br> Doggie Curtis's last day in Beijing began like a fairy tale, just like all the others. As usual, the little group of Americans had begun by eating breakfast in the hotel's dining room, surrounded by smiling waiters. Aside from Rosalie Lee and Caroll Jansen, whose finer motor functions seemed to be on the level of a stranded jellyfish, everyone was eating with chopsticks.<br><br> Doggie gazed through the large windows at the city's skyline with its scalelike tiled roofs on clusters of hutongs. They had wandered through the Summer Palace's enchanting, long corridors, breathed the air at Beihai Lake, and silently contemplated the calm that enveloped the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests. The days had flown by, and now they were going to take a bus ride to the silk market, followed by a walk along the market's narrow streets to the nearby American consulate. That evening they were going to the circus, and the next day they would begin a trip around the Chinese countryside-Xi'an, the Yellow River, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and back again. It was a question of getting as much out of these remaining days as possible.<br><br> The market seemed remarkably quiet. Even the few curious people who were following along after the group were silent. None called out to them; no one was pushy.<br><br> "They sure do business in an orderly fashion here," whispered John Bugatti at Doggie's side. "You should see how they assault you in Hong Kong or Taipei. It'll probably be like that here in a couple of years, just wait and see."<br><br> She nodded and let her eyes wander over counters overflowing with bolts of material and multicolored silk dresses and scarves. One she saw would look perfect on her mother.<br><br> "What do you think that one costs? What's that say?" she asked Bugatti, pointing at a sign written in Chinese.<br><br> Suddenly, Caroll Jansen came out of nowhere and put her arm around Doggie's shoulder. "That one would look perfect on you!" She smiled, took out her wallet, gave the seller some money, and chose to ignore the fact that he didn't smile back as he folded up the scarf and handed it over the counter's rough planks.<br><br> "Come over here, Doggie!" called out Governor Jansen, who was standing before a large population of small Chinese figurines of an indeterminable material. "Look! This one brings good luck. May I have permission to give you one?"<br><br> The shopping took only a few more minutes and they were on their way towards the consulate, Doggie with a new scarf over her shoulder and a little, hollow Buddha figurine under her arm. She was proud and happy. Governor Jansen had looked her deep in the eyes and assured her that the little icon symbolized an eternal bond of friendship between them. "You just come to me if you ever need help," he said. It was amazing.<br><br> She hunched her shoulders and took a deep breath of the sharp morning air. Everything was perfect: her traveling companions, the exotic trees, and all the people going about their business. She smiled at the workers sitting on the edge of the sidewalk with chopsticks and small bowls, eating warm food from the stalls lined up behind them.<br><br> Wesley Barefoot was walking in front of her with a smile so broad, she could see it from behind.<br><br> He was pointing in all directions with one eye glued to a cheap, newly acquired camera. T. Perkins was walking along beside him, eyes alert, a plastic bag in each hand filled with all kinds of toys for nieces and nephews. At the head of the procession strode Governor Bruce Jansen in the best of moods with his wife under his arm. As they approached the consulate, he waved to one of the officials who was on his way across the street to greet them. Doggie looked up at the building. As she expected, it was smaller than the embassy on Xiushui Bei'jie where they'd eaten a delicious welcoming dinner two days before, but it still made a vivid, pompous impression in the sunshine, with the Stars and Stripes flapping in the breeze and an erect Chinese sentry standing on a low platform before the entry gate.<br><br> Doggie glanced over her shoulder, back down the crowded, narrow street of tradesmen and their stalls. There was a world of difference between the Western-style, official opulence of the consulate and the flimsy, thrown-together stalls of the silk market. It revealed a huge gulf in wealth and customs.<br><br> A little street seller was casting one of his many colorful dragon kites up into the breeze and the group paused to watch it wriggle towards the sky.<br><br> Then it happened.<br><br> Caroll Jansen suddenly screamed and struck out with both arms, her purse clutched in one hand. Doggie whirled around as her cry ended abruptly and she sank to the ground, blood squirting from her neck, while Governor Jansen's advisor, Thomas Sunderland, lunged after the young Chinese attacker. Sheriff T. Perkins flung away his plastic bags, so the sidewalk in front of the consulate came to life with bouncing rubber balls and small, plastic animals of every description, and in one leap he succeeded in cutting off the man's escape route back into the teaming silk market. Doggie would always remember the assailant's bloody knife, still gleaming as he tried to ward off the charging sheriff.<br><br> Next she saw Governor Jansen falling to his knees, the figure in his arms already lifeless. Her lips moved silently as people rushed from all directions to help. She saw everything: Rosalie Lee shredding her best blouse into strips to try and stem Caroll Jansen's bleeding, the soldiers racing over to T. Perkins, who, with blood running down his arm, had pinned the kicking, howling killer to the ground. And she saw Wesley Barefoot, standing still as a statue in the middle of everything, his face white as a corpse.</p><h2>DK Eyewitness Northern Spain (Travel Guide)</h2><p><p>Explore the historic cathedrals and architecture, stroll through wineries, and see beautiful beaches in northern Spain.</p><p>Discover <b><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Northern Spain</i></b>.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Detailed itineraries and "don't-miss" destination highlights at a glance. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Illustrated cutaway 3-D drawings of important sights. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Floor plans and guided visitor information for major museums. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Guided walking tours, local drink and dining specialties to try, things to do, and places to eat, drink, and shop by area. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Area maps marked with sights. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Detailed city maps include street finder indexes for easy navigation. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Insights into history and culture to help you understand the stories behind the sights. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Hotel and restaurant listings highlight DK Choice special recommendations. <br><p>With hundreds of full-color photographs, hand-drawn illustrations, and custom maps that illuminate every page, <b><i>DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Northern Spain</i></b> truly shows you this region as no one else can.</p><p><b>Series Overview:</b> For more than two decades, DK Eyewitness Travel Guides have helped travelers experience the world through the history, art, architecture, and culture of their destinations.

A reluctant military hero, Flashman plays a key part in most of the defining military campaigns of the 19th century, despite trying his utmost to escape them all. When our hero Flashman accepts an invitation from his old enemy, Tom Brown of Rugby, to join in a friendly cricket match, he does not suspect that he is letting himself in for the most desperate game of his scandalous career. What follows is a deadly struggle that sees him scampering from the hallowed wicket of Lord&#39;s to the jungle lairs of Borneo pirates; from a Newgate hanging to the torture pits of Madagascar, and from Chinatown&#39;s vice dens to slavery in the palace of &#39;the female Caligula&#39; herself, Queen Ranavalona of Madagascar.

Before he published books highlighting and celebrating the great Catholic cultural tradition, he disseminated literature extolling the virtues of the white race, and calling for the banishment of all non-white from Britain.<br><br> Pearce and his cohorts were at the center of the racial and nationalist tensions&#x2014;often violent&#x2014;that swirled around London in the late-1970s and early 80s. Eventually Pearce became a top member of the National Front, and the editor of its newspaper, <i>The Bulldog</i>. He was a full-time revolutionary.<br><br> In 1982 he was imprisoned for six months for hate speech, but he came out with more anger, and more resolve. Several years later, he was imprisoned again, this time for a year and it spurred a change in his life.<br><br> In <b><i>Race with the Devil: My Journey from Racial Hatred to Rational Love</i></b>, Pearce himself takes the reader through his journey from racist revolutionary to Christian, including:<br><ul><li>The youthful influences that lead him to embrace the National Front and their racist platform</li><li>His dark, angry, exhilarating but ultimately empty days as a revolutionary on the front lines</li><li>His imprisonment and subsequent dark night of the soul</li><li>The role that Catholic luminaries such as G.

A writer, a spy and later an art dealer, Logan mixes with the men and women who shaped the twentieth century. But he&#39;s also a son, a husband and a lover, and he makes the same mistakes we all do in his search for happiness. William Boyd&#39;s bestselling novel, a rich, intriguing and entertaining account of a life lived to the full, comes to the tv screen in a major new series scripted by the author himself.</p><p>Logan Gonzago Mountstuart, writer, was born in 1906, and died of a heart attack on October 5, 1991, aged 85. William Boyd's novel <i>Any Human Heart</i> is his disjointed autobiography, a massive tome chronicling "my personal rollercoaster"--or rather, "not so much a rollercoaster", but a yo-yo, "a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child." From his early childhood in Montevideo, son of an English corned beef executive and his Uraguayan secretary, through his years at a Norfolk public school and Oxford, Mountstuart traces his haphazard development as a writer. Early and easy success is succeeded by a long half-century of mediocrity, disappointments and setbacks, both personal and professional, leading him to multiple failed marriages, internment, alcoholism and abject poverty. <p> Mountstuart's sorry tale is also the story of a British way of life in inexorable decline, as his journey takes in the Bloomsbury set, the General Strike, the Spanish Civil War, 1930s Americans in Paris, wartime espionage, New York avant garde art, even the Baader-Meinhof gang--all with a stellar supporting cast. The most sustained and best moment comes mid-book, as Mountstuart gets caught up in one of Britain's murkier wartime secrets, in the company of the here truly despicable Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere author William Boyd occasionally misplaces his tongue too obviously in his cheek--the Wall Street Crash is trailed with truly crashing inelegance--but overall <i>Any Human Heart</i> is a witty, inventive and ultimately moving novel. Boyd succeeds in conjuring not only a compelling 20th century but also, in the hapless Logan Mountstuart, an anti-hero who achieves something approaching passive greatness. <i>--Alan Stewart</i>, Amazon.co.uk</p><b>Praise from England for <i>Any Human Heart<br></i></b><i><br></i>"A work of astonishing ventriloquistic virtuosity . . . A brilliant evocation of a past era . . . One finds oneself almost reading the journals as genuine . . . which is quite a feat, because Boyd has skillfully mimicked the artless and random qualities of every diary."<br>- Caroline Moore, <i>Sunday Telegraph<br><br></i>"A book full of delights . . . No one is better than William Boyd at drawing the reader into [a] tale from the very first sentence."<br>- Erica Wagner, <i>The Times<br><br></i>"An excellent picaresque novel, written in a confident, easy-going style . . . <i>Any Human Heart</i> is an old-fashioned, new-fangled tour de force which maintains its brio to the very end. An obvious contender for the next round of literary prizes, it would be considered a worthy and genuinely popular winner of any one of them."<br>- Anita Brookner,<i> The Spectator<br><br></i>"Boyd's terrific powers of storytelling are given free rein here: this is a biography where you don't know the ending, and he keeps you glued and guessing . . . One of Boyd's most enjoyable novels to date: generous, witty and sneakily profound."<br>- Catherine Shoard, <i>Evening Standard<br><br></i>"Compelling . . . An addictively enjoyable read as well as a testament to the endurance of the human heart."<br>- Geordie Grieg, <i>Literary Review<br><br></i>"Astounding. . .The most sincere measure of praise one can attach to William Boyd's new novel is that it ranks alongside <i>The New Confessions</i> as one of his great achievements . . . It also resembles the earlier book in its ambition and spirit, being an account of tumultuous tragicomic life that lasts from one end of the twentieth century to the other.

Sixteen years later, the French Ambassador Hugues de Terlon secretly unearthed Descartes' bones and transported them to France. <br><br>Why would this devoutly Catholic official care so much about the remains of a philosopher who was hounded from country to country on charges of atheism? Why would Descartes' bones take such a strange, serpentine path over the next 350 years&#x2014;a path intersecting some of the grandest events imaginable: the birth of science, the rise of democracy, the mind-body problem, the conflict between faith and reason? Their story involves people from all walks of life&#x2014;Louis XIV, a Swedish casino operator, poets and playwrights, philosophers and physicists, as these people used the bones in scientific studies, stole them, sold them, revered them as relics, fought over them, passed them surreptitiously from hand to hand.<br><br>The answer lies in Descartes&#x2019; famous phrase: Cogito ergo sum&#x2014;"I think, therefore I am." In his deceptively simple seventy-eight-page essay, <i>Discourse on the Method</i>, this small, vain, vindictive, peripatetic, ambitious Frenchman destroyed 2,000 years of received wisdom and laid the foundations of the modern world. At the root of Descartes&#x2019; &#x201c;method&#x201d; was skepticism: "What can I know for certain?" Like-minded thinkers around Europe passionately embraced the book--the method was applied to medicine, nature, politics, and society. The notion that one could find truth in facts that could be proved, and not in reliance on tradition and the Church's teachings, would become a turning point in human history.<br><br>In an age of faith, what Descartes was proposing seemed like heresy. Yet Descartes himself was a good Catholic, who was spurred to write his incendiary book for the most personal of reasons: He had devoted himself to medicine and the study of nature, but when his beloved daughter died at the age of five, he took his ideas deeper. To understand the natural world one needed to question everything. Thus the scientific method was created and religion overthrown. If the natural world could be understood, knowledge could be advanced, and others might not suffer as his child did. <br><br>The great controversy Descartes ignited continues to our era: where Islamic terrorists spurn the modern world and pine for a culture based on unquestioning faith; where scientists write bestsellers that passionately make the case for atheism; where others struggle to find a balance between faith and reason. <i><br>Descartes&#x2019; Bones</i>is a historical detective story about the creation of the modern mind, with twists and turns leading up to the present day&#x2014;to the science museum in Paris where the philosopher&#x2019;s skull now resides and to the church a few kilometers away where, not long ago, a philosopher-priest said a mass for his bones.</p></p><p>RUSSELL SHORTO is the bestselling author of<i> The Island at the Center of the World</i> and a contributing writer at<i> </i>the<i> New York Times Magazine.</i> He lives in Amsterdam.<b>THE MAN WHO DIED</b><br> IN THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF STOCKHOLM'S OLD Town stands a four-story building that was constructed during the busy, fussy period called the Baroque. Its red-brick facade is ornamented with sandstone cherubs and crests. Two upright cannons flank the entry; bearded busts gaze down sternly on those who approach the door. If you could somehow ignore the designer handbag shop and the upscale "Glenfiddich Warehouse" restaurant/bar occupying the ground floor, and the streams of tourists moving past on a summer afternoon, the structure would probably seem very much of the year--1630--when a merchant named Erik von der Linde built it.<br><br>In the dead of night in the dead of winter in the year 1650, the most solemn rite of passage was playing out on an upper floor of this building. People hurried between rooms, past windows that looked out onto the dark, icy harbor below, exchanging information and worried looks. But if the occasion was grave, it wasn't quiet. For someone close to death, the man who lay in bed--not quite fifty-four years old, small-boned, ashen, the center of everyone's attention--was alarmingly active. It was fury that gave him these last bursts of adrenaline. His friend and protege Pierre Chanut, the French ambassador to Sweden, in whose house he lay dying, was at his side constantly, trying to manage the man's anger while feeling doubly guilty: it was he who had urged Rene Descartes to come to this frozen land and he who had first contracted a fever, through which Descartes had nursed him before catching it himself.<br><br>Chanut fervently believed that Descartes was in the process of transforming the world with his revolutionary thinking. In this he was essentially correct. A change took place in the middle of the 1600s. People began to employ a new, sweeping kind of doubt, to question some of their most basic beliefs. The change was in a way more profound than the American and French revolutions, the Industrial Revolution, or the information age, because it underlay all of them and affected the very structure of people's thought--the way they perceived the world, the universe, and themselves in it. And the person most closely identified with this transformation was the man who lay dying in the Swedish winter. Pierre Chanut couldn't have known the scope of the future, but he knew, as did many others, that something staggeringly significant was afoot and that Descartes was at its center. It had by now dawned on the diplomat that, in bringing the philosopher here, he had unwittingly engineered a catastrophe.<br><br>The fever had given way to pneumonia; the patient's breath was ragged, his eyes wandering. Chanut had wanted to call the court physician, but Descartes raged against that idea. Finally, from her fairy tale palace on the other side of the small island in the harbor that was the center of Stockholm, Christina, the twenty-three-year-old queen of Sweden, who would go down as one of the more remarkable personalities in European history (there is, for starters, the centuries-old line of serious speculation that she was in fact a king), sent her physician to attend him. It was Christina who, with Chanut, had coaxed the intellectual celebrity northward in the first place.<br><br>The doctor, a Dutchman named Wullens, approached the bed reluctantly. There was a sharp exchange in which the philosopher made it venomously clear he thought the physician an ass. The encounter climaxed when Wullens proposed bloodletting, whereupon the patient erupted with a theatrical cry--"Gentlemen, spare French blood!"--and ordered the man out. Wullens departed, washing his hands of the business, muttering as he went a rather fatuous piece of consolation from the Roman poet Horace: "He who saves someone against his will does the same as to kill him."<br>The rage had two components. First, the philosopher had known Wullens during his long years in the Dutch provinces. One of the early public airings of Descartes' philosophy had come at Leiden University, and it caused an uproar among those who considered it a challenge to the whole system of education and thought that had been in existence throughout Europe for centuries. Wullens had stood with those who opposed the new philosophy. Descartes never forgot an enemy.<br><br>But there was another reason for the anger. In a peculiar way, much of Descartes' career had been a kind of chess match with death, and for a long time he had actually convinced himself that he had the upper hand. He had been a sickly child, with a pale complexion and a dry cough that he had inherited from his mother, who died when he was a year old. His father--a jurist and a man of power and ambition--seems to have despised the child's weakness and favored his older brother. The family doctors didn't bother to hide from the boy their conviction that he would die young.<br><br>When he was ten, however, Descartes was sent off to the Jesuit college of La Fleche in Anjou, one of the finest educational establishments in Europe. There, to his surprise, he flourished. He became strong, healthy, vigorous, aware of the wider world, and hungry for knowledge. But the early experience remained lodged inside him. When he settled into his mature work, medicine became its central focus. He developed his revolutionary philosophy, with its grounding not in the Bible or ancient writers but in human reason, and became famous and infamous for it. But the heart of it, the deep reason for it, was his desire to solve the puzzle of the body, to cure disease, and to lengthen human life--including his own. At the end of the Discourse on the Method, his epoch-changing work of philosophy, he vowed to the reader not that in the future he would craft a revised metaphysics or a new approach to mathematics but that he would "devote what time I may still have to live to no other occupation than that of endeavoring to acquire some knowledge of Nature, which shall be of such a kind as to enable us therefrom to deduce rules in medicine of greater certainty than those in present use." Five years before he lay dying in Sweden he wrote to an English earl, "The preservation of health has always been the principal end of my studies."<br><br>The same goal was in the minds of many of his contemporaries. When we think of science and the spark of modernity, we tend to think of astronomy: Galileo crafting his telescopes and peering into the skies above central Italy; locating sunspots, moons around Jupiter, craters on the earth's moon, and other irregularities in a universe that the church had taught was perfect; amassing data that corroborated the theory that the earth revolves around the sun; encountering the systematic wrath of the Inquisition. In our perennial effort to understand who we are and what it means that we are "modern," we choose astronomy as a starting point in part because it provides a sturdy metaphorical peg for thinking of the massive change that humanity underwent in the seventeenth century, when we--seemingly--left our mythic, biblical selves behind and reoriented ourselves in the cosmos. In 1957--the year of Sputnik and the dawning of the space age, a time when people had a simpler, clearer sense of "modern" than they do today and felt ready to embrace what they thought the word meant--a best-selling book expressed this idea in its title: the change was "From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe."<br><br>But one could just as easily see modernity springing from the intense interest in the human body that arose in Europe at the same time. If our place in the universe is an elemental marker of who we think we are, our physical being is something more. The magnitude of human suffering down the centuries is somewhat quantifiable. The life expectancy of a child born in Descartes' France was twenty-eight; in England between 1540 and 1800 it was an estimated thirty-seven. Similar rates--in the twenties and thirties--held for high-born citizens of ancient Rome, forager societies in Africa and South America, and people in rural India and China into the early twentieth century. More than half of all children born in London around the time of the American Revolution could be expected to die by age fifteen. And most deaths in early modern Europe were caused not by war or marauding brigands but by disease. Century upon century, hour after desperate hour, parents watched helplessly as their children succumbed to maladies whose very names--ague, apoplexy, flux, dropsy, commotion, consumption--spoke of the misty ignorance that was a definitive sentence.<br><br>The mists have lifted somewhat in three and a half centuries--we live longer and healthier lives--and still the body remains a touchstone of modernity. Zoloft, Lipitor, Viagra, Botox, ibuprofen, angioplasty, insulin, birth control pills, hormone replacement therapy, anabolic steroids--we don't merely allow science and technology into our physical beings but insist that they continually do more to better manipulate and aid the brute facts of our flesh and blood and bone selves. Embedded in this outlook is an idea of the body as a machine, so that illness is seen as a breakdown of the machine, healing involves repairing the broken parts, and a doctor is a kind of mechanic with medications as his or her tools. This simplistic view has been changing in the last twenty or thirty years. We have a hankering now to see mind and body as deeply connected, to appreciate the way thoughts and the environment influence our physical being. Yet the mechanical model has been very successful, and our medicine is still largely constructed around it. And it was this model that came into being in Descartes' generation.<br><br>This new way of viewing the human body was bewildering when it was first aired. Many people, in fact, equated it with atheism. It was frankly at odds with the overall approach to knowledge in the period against which modernity arose. Aristotelianism, or Scholasticism, was a blend of Christian theology and thinking derived from Aristotle and other ancient Greeks. These streams of thought had stewed together f...</p><h2>Maximilian and Juarez</h2><p>Napoleon III attempts to make the Austrian Archduke Maximilian the successor of Mexico&#39;s great nationalist leader, Benito Jua+a7rez, and sets the stage for a war of national liberation and the rise of United States influence in the hemisphere.</p><p>Jasper Ridley gave up his practice at the bar to become one of the leading historical biographers of England, and his most recent book, Lord Palmerston, was awarded the James Tait Black Prize. He has twice stood for Parliament, and his personal experience of political affairs has given him added insight into the career of the most successful of Nineteenth-century revolutionaries. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.Ridley ( Elizabeth I ) offers a highly-detailed narrative of Napoleon III's strange, tragic mid-19th-century effort to install the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximillian as emperor of Mexico. Drawing on a wealth of sources, Ridley ably reconstructs the battle between Mexican liberal nationalists and conservative monarchists, the role of liberal leader Benito Juarez, the intervention of the Great Powers and the background of the indecisive archduke. The complex story includes debates over religious tolerance, jockeying over alliances with the Confederate States or with the Union, and the persistence of Juarez's guerrillas against the occupying French. When Napoleon, who had banked on a Confederate victory, wished to avoid war with the United States, he began a process that led to liberal victory and Maximillian's capture and execution. Those unfamiliar with the story may find the book, which would have benefited from a supplemental time line or chronology, confusing.

Nor is Nathan any closer to his personal goal: getting revenge on Annalise, the girl he once loved, before she committed an unthinkable crime. There is an amulet, protected by the extremely powerful witch Ledger, which could be the tool Nathan needs to save himself and the Alliance. But the amulet is not so easily acquired. And lately Nathan has started to suffer from visions: a vision of a golden moment when he dies, and of an endless line of Hunters, impossible to overcome.

She grew up in the '40s on the Welsh border, in the crossfire between her grandparents, a bitter, bibulous, bookish vicar resembling Jack Sprat and his short, "fat doll" of an ignorant wife. He preached earthy sermons about how one might prefer for a wife "Martha before dinner, Mary after dinner." His wife's "notion of marriage [was] that a man signed you up to have his wicked way with you and should spend the rest of his life <i>paying through the nose</i>." Grandma blackmailed the vicar with his diary of adultery, in which she scribbled vicious comments invaluable to the family historian. She gobbled sweets; he drank, fumed, and helped make Lorna Sage a noted literary critic. There is much more: the vicar's affair with his daughter's school chum, the cosmic impact of Bill Haley and his Comets, Lorna's precocious pregnancy, and the strange way lives ricochet and echo each other. Sage manages to give her rural upbringing a brooding Gothic poignance and the comic force of <i>Cold Comfort Farm</i>. She describes a moment after her grandfather's death in the vicarage, "where everything seemed to be wearing thin and getting see-through, as though a spell were dissolving." But the shades of her clan won't quite fade, and thanks to this book, they're here to stay. <i>--Tim Appelo</i><p>Lorna Sage's adventure in autobiography is a searing and funny anatomy of three marriages that brings to life her girlhood in postwar provincial Britain. Her early childhood was dominated by her brilliant, bitter grandfather, a drinker, a womanizer, a vicar, exiled to a remote village on the Welsh borders. His wife loathed him, lived on memories, and shook her fist at any parishioner bold enough to call at the house. From the vicarage Lorna watched the fading away of the old world and the slow dissolve of her grandparents' disastrous Union.</p><p>Then her father returns from the army and she moves with her parents and baby brother into a newly built house. Living with her parents, she quickly learns that the world is full of secrets and myths that mark her family -- her mother's thwarted dreams, her father's addiction to work, and the mysterious emotional economy of their proper marriage. Longing to leave, Lorna vows she will never marry of have children, but before long she finds herself having grown up far too fast.</p><p>From the memories of her family and of the wounds they inflicted on one another, she tells an extraordinary tale of thwarted love, failed religion, and the salvation she found in books. As a portrait of a family and a young girl's place in it, it is unsurpassed.</p></p><h2>Adaptation to Life</h2><p><p>Between 1939 and 1942, one of America's leading universities recruited 268 of its healthiest and most promising undergraduates to participate in a revolutionary new study of the human life cycle. The originators of the program, which came to be known as the Grant Study, felt that medical research was too heavily weighted in the direction of disease, and their intent was to chart the ways in which a group of promising individuals coped with their lives over the course of many years.</p><p>Nearly forty years later, George E. Vaillant, director of the Study, took the measure of the Grant Study men. The result was the compelling, provocative classic, <i>Adaptation to Life</i>, which poses fundamental questions about the individual differences in confronting life's stresses. Why do some of us cope so well with the portion life offers us, while others, who have had similar advantages (or disadvantages), cope badly or not at all? Are there ways we can effectively alter those patterns of behavior that make us unhappy, unhealthy, and unwise?</p><p>George Vaillant discusses these and other questions in terms of a clearly defined scheme of "adaptive mechanisms" that are rated mature, neurotic, immature, or psychotic, and illustrates, with case histories, each method of coping.</p></p><p>George E.

I had not yet learned that a mild, sunny beginning to an Irish morning does not obviate the necessity for a sheepskin coat and gumboots at a slightly later hour, and I could not, for the life of me, see the Galway Bay Sailing Club.</p><p>I drove back to the Thatched Pub in Oranmore and explained my problem to its keeper. As he had already done twice on that morning, he began patiently to direct me to Rinville Bay. I interrupted to explain that I was certain I had found the bay but could not find the clubhouse.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said George the innkeeper, with the raised eyebrows of the enlightened, &#x201c;there&#x2019;s not a clubhouse, y&#x2019;see; there&#x2019;s just theclub, like.&#x201d;</p><p>I gaped at him uncomprehendingly, unable to shake my preconception of the neat building, the flagpole, and the ruddy-faced chaps gathered in the net-draped bar. George leapt into the silence, which every Irishman abhors: &#x201c;There&#x2019;s just the club, and I&#x2019;d say they&#x2019;re not likely to be out just yet.&#x201d; It was March, I had to give him that, but it was a Sunday too, and the paperback I had read had led me to believe that your enthusiastic yachtsman, if not actually on the water nowabouts, would at least be varnishing or splicing something in preparation for the event, and if not that, knocking a few back and talking about it at the very least.</p><p>George fixed his gaze on the Guinness pump handle before him, trying hard to be helpful. &#x201c;Pierce Purcell,&#x201d; he said, looking relieved. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d want to speak to Pierce Purcell, he&#x2019;s the secretary or one of the people, like, and you&#x2019;d find him in the book.&#x201d;</p><p>The Irish Department of Posts and Telegraphs, because of the small size of the country, the low density of the population, and its own extreme reluctance to provide any of them with a telephone, has managed to gather all the nation&#x2019;s telephone listings into just one directory, which is, in size, roughly equal to the combined bulk of the Old Testament, the New Testament,the I Ching, and The Joy of Sex. It proved to contain at least a page of closely spaced Purcells, far too many of them P.&#x2019;s, P.J.&#x2019;s and even Pierces, and none of them in Galway. George tried again.</p><p>&#x201c;Ferdia O&#x2019;Riordan,&#x201d; he said, this time with real conviction. The book offered us even more O&#x2019;Riordans than Purcells, but no Ferdias in Galway. &#x201c;The Bank of Ireland,&#x201d; said George with finality. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where he works, at the branch in Salthill.&#x201d; But in Ireland only the pubs are open on a Sunday, so I thanked George and postponed my search for sailing yet another day.</p><p>Sailing had been wafting around the hindmost part of my head since the summer of 1966, when friends had invited me to their summer home in Castine, Maine, and, back in my native USA, taken me sailing every day the wind blew. I had been enchanted with the notion that one could move across the face of the waters, fueled by nothing more than the wind, and I had resolved that if ever I were domiciled in any reasonable proximity to the sea I would learn to sail upon it. I thought, even, that since so much of the world was covered with water and since it lapped against so many interesting places, that I should like to sail right the way round, stopping everywhere.</p><p>Eventually, I finished a ten-year hitch in New York advertising, did another three in London, and then, propelled by a lifelong desire to write A Novel, hied myself to the west of Ireland, to County Galway, to Lough Cutra Castle, near Gort, where I resided not in the castle but in the adjacent stableyard, in a flat. I spent two days a week in Dublin, writing television commercials and ads for an advertising agency, and the rest of the time in County Galway, writing my novel or, at least, thinking about it.</p><p>Lough Cutra was an ideal place&#x2014;four hundred acres of grounds, twelve hundred acres of lake, and enough peace and quiet to make it very difficult to find an excuse not to write. To live this sort of existence you have to be either very lucky or very single. Looking back, I still find it difficult to believe I was able to get away with this for two years.</p><p>Soon after my arrival in Ireland, in early 1973, I perceived that it was surrounded by water, and the sailing notion, so long displaced by an absorbing career and an athletic social life in New York and London, began to winnow its way into my frontal lobe. I bought a book which suggested that the way to go about learning to sail was to start with a small dinghy, then work up to larger things as desire and funds dictated. For several winter weeks I scoured the west, looking for a small boat to buy or someone who knew where to buy one or someone who knew someone who knew. Just when I was beginning to think that I was the only person in the counties Galway, Clare, and Mayo who realized that Ireland was an island, a friend in Galway, who believed that water should be fished in and not sailed upon, admitted that he had heard of the existence of a sailing club in or near Galway City.</p><p>He was pretty cagey about it all, but still, I had managed to penetrate the alleged club&#x2019;s apparent security arrangements to the point where I now had an actual name and an actual telephone number to call. Journeying to the public telephone in Mrs. Piggot&#x2019;s Grocery Store in Gort, I gave the operator the number, inserted the required coinage into the instrument, and waited the customary seven minutes to be connected. To my surprise, there really was a Ferdia O&#x2019;Riordan at the Bank of Ireland in Salthill, and he very generously invited me to join him for a sail the following Sunday, behaving as if the Galway Bay Sailing Club were common knowledge and had nothing whatever to hide.</p><p>During the week which followed I reread my book on sailing and bought another, wishing to be as au fait as possible without actually having set foot in any sort of boat for seven years. The Sunday arrived and I again found myself at Rinville. Nothing had changed, except that the wind was blowing slightly less hard and the temperature had crept up a degree or two. The place was still deserted, and I sat in my battered Mini, chatting idly with Fred, a four-pound, five-week-old example of the golden Labrador breed, who graciously permitted me to share my flat with him. At last, a car materialized next to mine, towing a boat covered with canvas. From this car emerged Ferdia O&#x2019;Riordan, his very pretty wife, and two irresistible little girls, with whom Fred evidenced an immediate empathy. Leaving the two children and the puppy rolling in the grass, we removed the canvas from the boat, revealing a gleaming example of the GP Fourteen class, erected the mast, bent on the sails, and trundled the lot at breakneck speed down the rocky shore. Ferdia and I stripped off our shoes and socks, rolled up our trouser legs, and waded into the icy water. In a trice, I was experiencing again that giddy sensation of motion over water which had so mesmerized me in Maine seven summers before.</p><p>We thrashed about Rinville Bay, Ferdia issuing a steady stream of calm instructions, I trying to remember what I had read during the last week, while shifting my weight about in such a way as to keep us upright, and endeavoring to cope with sheets, cleats, and centerboard. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re nearly planing now,&#x201d; Ferdia said at one point. I made a mental note to find out what &#x201c;planing&#x201d; meant. It had a familiar ring.</p><p>Back on shore, while gathering my wits about me again, Ferdia, who turned out to be the club secretary, produced a membership form and relieved me of a check. We discussed what sort of boat I should buy and the consensus seemed to be a Mirror, a ten-foot ten-inch plywood dinghy whose design had been sponsored by the newspaper of the same name, which could be bought ready-built or in kit form, and which was the most popular boat in the club.</p><p>Considering that in an entire year of woodworking classes in high school I had produced only one wobbly bookcase and half a lamp base, I thought the ready-built form of the boat appealed most, although I was assured that twelve Girl Scouts had once built one in eight hours. (Twelve Girl Scouts represent a multiplication of my woodworking talents by a factor of twenty-four.) Since demand for these little boats was high and supply slow, I would probably have to wait a bit for delivery, but the club, it was disclosed, owned two Mirrors for the use of members who did not themselves own boats, so I would be able to sail in the meantime. Also, the club was holding a boat show in a couple of weeks&#x2019; time, and there I would be able to peruse a number of other craft before purchasing.</p><p>During the time remaining until the boat show I dropped by Rinville several times more, and on one occasion was invited out for a sail in a twenty-foot dayboat by a rumpled fellow of about my own age, who looked as I imagined a Galway fisherman looked and, to my American ear, sounded. It is a measure of my discernment in these matters at that stage of my Irish experience that he turned out to be the Minister for Local Government.</p><p>The First Annual Galway Boat Show took place in the car park of the Salthill Hotel. On display were a dozen assorted dinghies and powerboats, some fishing and diving gear, and other water-oriented paraphernalia. Also on display was a gleaming new Mirror dinghy, which was being raffled as a fund-raising project for the club, and which I did not win. However, a large Dutchman and I unearthed one of the club Mirrors from Ferdia O&#x2019;Riordan&#x2019;s garage and, after an hour or so of puzzling over fittings, rigging, and sails, got it afloat.</p><p>We pottered about between Black Rock Pier and the Margaretta Buoy in the middle of Galway Bay, tacking and jibing the little boat in a lovely breeze. My reading program was paying off handsomely, things making a great deal more sense than they had on my first outing with Ferdia. I had another short sail with another member, and then dropped him off at the pier.</p><p>My recent reading had included Sir Francis Chichester&#x2019;s book Gypsy Moth Circles the World and Joshua Slocum&#x2019;s superb account of his three-year circumnavigation in the last century, the first by a man alone. No doubt these had served as some sort of inspiration, for I pushed off in the little dinghy and sailed her single-handed out to the buoy and back, ajangle at the newness of it all and terrified of capsizing the thing in sight of the crowd on the pier. This was a kind of high several notches above sailing with somebody else. Now, for better or for drowning, I had the thing all to myself, my first command, as it were, and I relished the experience. Tacking around the buoy went much as the book had said it should; the dinghy scooted across the water, seemingly in defiance of, rather than in harmony with, the laws of nature, and I returned to shore light-headed, as if having breathed an enriched atmosphere.</p><p>I felt it was some sort of beginning, though of what I wasn&#x2019;t certain, and to my distant fantasy of sailing around the world was added the even more fantastic notion of doing some part of it alone, and although the next time I sailed a boat alone the circumstances were much more exotic and the possible consequences far more serious, the special euphoria of that first, short, single-handed voyage remained unrivaled.</p><p><b>Two</b></p><p>Carol, Fred, and I arrived at Rosturk Castle on a Friday evening in June, the club dinghy in tow behind the Mini. Carol, an old friend from both New York and London days, was passing through Ireland on her way back to live in the States, and we had been invited up to County Mayo for the Westport Show. The dinghy, much used and a bit battered, was for sailing in Westport Bay, for Rosturk Castle is situated on one of the most beautiful inlets of that very beautiful body of water.</p><p>Sunday we went sailing, which was not as simple as it sounds. The inlet on which Rosturk stands habitually dries out twice a day, when the tide recedes, leaving a quarter-mile or so of lovely golden sand to replace the water, which ends up some distance from the castle. Since our time of rising and breakfasting coincided with low water, it was necessary for someone to come with us down the long strip of sand to the water&#x2019;s edge in the Mini and, after the dinghy had been launched, return to the house with the car and Fred, who, in the two or three times I had sailed since my debut, had shown himself to be not much in the way of a yachtsman. He either fell asleep with his head on the tiller or strolled about the decks until he fell into the water. He was, at least, good for man-overboard drills.</p><p>We successfully launched the dinghy and sailed off into an already increasing breeze. Westport Bay is filled with islands, reputedly 365 of them, and it had been our intention to sail among them for a sufficient number of hours for the tide to allow us to sail right up to the doorstep of the castle. However, on the water everything looks a bit different; the wind blows a bit harder, the waves are a bit steeper, and, on top of everything else, it was starting to drizzle. I am not sure if I had confided the state of my experience to Carol, but she seemed willing to sail wherever I wished, so I probably hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Webeat out from behind an island and the wind and waves both grew in strength&#x2014;not to an alarming state, but sailing the boat required great concentration. There was little time for absorbing the beauties of Westport Bay. Carol, incredibly, managed to light a cigarette. We agreed that a shorter sail than originally conceived was in order. We sailed around the island and headed into the channel separating it from the shore where the castle stood. Then we were running, that is, the wind was directly behind us, and so were the waves. We began to surf in a small way, which was exciting, and then we &#x201c;broached to,&#x201d; which was a little too exciting. When a boat which is running broaches, it appears suddenly to change its mind about the direction in which it is sailing and to attempt to change its course, swinging abruptly around and abeam to the wind. This action, in proper concert with a passing wave, can cause the occupants of a dinghy to become swimmers. We were wearing buoyancy aids, but these did not make the prospect seem any more inviting. We broached twice before I learned to anticipate the movement and keep us on a straight course.</p><p>We drove on up the inlet until the boat touched the sand, then we hopped out. We were still a quarter-mile from the castle. I sent Carol up for the car and trailer while I got the sails down and stood in the water, holding the dinghy. The tide was coming in quite fast now.</p><p>Carol arrived with the car and backed the trailer down to the edge of the water, which was still several yards away from the Mini. I unhitched the trailer, pushed it down to the dinghy, and asked Carol to help me ...</p></p><h2>Brook Trout</h2><p>North America has had a four-hundred-year love affair with the brook trout - Salvelinus fontinalis - its great native trout. And now Nick Karas offers the first major profile of this most beautiful of gamefish. Brook Trout is a thorough look at the history, biology, and angling possibilities of the fish most fishermen affectionately call the brookie. Through the eyes of a trained ichthyologist, Karas explores the brook trout&#39;s biology and the events that led to its evolution and distribution. He unravels the controversies surrounding the two largest brook trout ever taken. But the core of this book is the fishery: its past status, current condition, and future. And because the history of brook-trout fishing is inseparable from the history of American fishing, Karas follows the development of the rods, reels, lines, lures, and flies that evolved as anglers continued their fascination with this great gamefish.</p><p>Nick Karas is the author of a half dozen books for sportsmen, including The Striped Bass, and is the longtime outdoor columnist for New York Newsday.<br>The much maligned brook trout gets star billing in this encyclopedic, readable study of Salvelinus fontinalis from Newsday outdoor columnist Karas. Many anglers give the brook trout a bum rap, considering it an inferior quarry to the wily, fighting browns and rainbows. But there is also a dedicated band of brook trout fanciers, who find in this exquisite fish--decked out in black and olive, rose and pearl, accessorized with light green shading to yellow squiggles and vermilion dots haloed in powder blue--the very stuff of our continent's angling past, a synecdoche testifying to clear, cold, pure waters, to a life pristine and unpretentious. Karas is decidedly in the latter group, his book a labor of love: ``Our relationship with this unique fish has never been fully documented or evaluated,'' he writes. It has been now. Karas goes back into the mists of paleoichthyology to get a handle on beginnings; charts distribution in post-glacial times; scrutinizes species, subspecies, strains (the brook isn't a trout but a char); offloads a bargeful of fish stories. The author devotes the majority of the book to the history of brook trout fishing in New York and Canada, from remote headwaters to rivers the mention of which--Nipigon and Minipi and Ashuanipi--get brook-trouters in a lather; and closes with the rude effects of acid rain on wild trout waters, this after logging and mining had already trashed the habitat. This is the kind of book anglers long for: smartly written, free of hyperbole, full of obscure historical tidbits, laced with snatches from old diaries and letters, and enticingly informative (from mere clues to gift-horse treats) on how and where to fish for wild brook trout today. Angling literature, burdened as it is by overproduction, has every reason to celebrate Karas's brook trout encomium.

Despite its unlikely origins, though, there was nothing remotely quaint about this pivotal moment in history&#x2013;the unprecedented shooting by American soldiers of dozens of their fellow citizens, leading directly to the arming of American police forces. <br><br><i>The Shakespeare Riots</i> recounts the story of this momentous night, its two larger-than-life protagonists, and the myriad political and cultural currents that fueled the violence. In an engrossing narrative that moves at a breakneck pace from the American frontier to the Mississippi River, to the posh theaters of London, to the hangouts of the most notorious street gangs of the day, Nigel Cliff weaves a spellbinding saga of soaring passions, huge egos, and venal corruption. <br><br>Cliff charts the course of this tragedy from its beginnings as a somewhat comical contretemps between Englishman William Charles Macready, the haughty lion of the London stage, and Edwin Forrest, the first great American star and a popular hero to millions. Equally celebrated, and equally self-centered, the two were once friends, then adversaries. Exploiting this rivalry, &#x201c;nativist&#x201d; agitators organized mobs of bullyboys to flex their muscle by striking a blow against the foppish Macready and the Old World&#x2019;s cultural hegemony that he represented. <br><br>The moment Macready took the stage in New York, his adversaries sprang into action, first by throwing insults, then rotten eggs, then chairs. When he dared show his face again, an estimated twenty thousand packed the streets around the theater. As cobblestones from outside rained down on the audience, National Guard troops were called in to quell the riot. Finding themselves outmatched, the Guardsmen discharged their weapons at the crowd, with horrific results. When the smoke cleared, as many as thirty people lay dead, with scores more wounded.<br><br><i>The Shakespeare Riots</i> is social and cultural history of the highest order. In this wondrous saga Nigel Cliff immerses readers in the bustle of mid-nineteenth-century New York, re-creating the celebrity demimonde of the day and capturing all the high drama of a violent night that robbed a nation of its innocence.</p><p>Nigel Cliff was educated at Oxford University, where he was awarded a double First in English and the Beddington Prize for English literature.

This is his first book.Chapter 1 <br><br>A Shakespearean Ark &nbsp;<br><br>One day in the fall of 1814 a traveling actor named Noble Luke Usher presented himself at the door of the theatre in Albany, New York, and offered his services for a few nights; Macbeth, he added, was his preferred choice for his debut. Usher was known to have performed in at least three eastern cities and he was engaged on the spot. Soon he had befriended the theatre&#x2019;s stage manager, an Englishman in his mid-forties called Samuel Drake, and confided in him that his real motive in coming to Albany was to engage a company of actors to follow him to Kentucky, where he had three theatres waiting to welcome them. Drake agreed to put the word around and quietly assemble a small group, which he would lead out in the spring. Nothing more was heard of Usher until a letter arrived from his uncle, informing Drake that Noble Luke had died on a ridge of the Allegheny Mountains on his way back to Kentucky and asking whether he was willing to take over the theatres himself. Noble Luke, who had once acted with Edgar Allan Poe&#x2019;s parents, would later be immortalized in &#x201c;The Fall of the House of Usher.&#x201d; Meanwhile Samuel Drake found himself en route to deepest Kentucky while the ashes of the War of 1812 were still smoldering all around.1 The War of 1812 had been muddled together from the almighty mess of the Napoleonic Wars, with a large dash of unfinished business from the American Revolution. The Royal Navy was being ravaged by deserters, many of whom had jumped ship for the better pay and less grisly conditions of the American merchant fleet, and their Admiralty&#x2019;s solution, which proved as gainful as it was tactless, was to board vessels flying the American flag, often when they were barely out of harbor, and haul off every sailor found cowering behind a capstan. In the process, since Britain classed British-born American citizens as British subjects, several thousand American seamen were impressed into military service with the motherland. Several more were cut down in the cannon fire, and the headless corpse of one helmsman was put on display at a New York coffeehouse, a more effective propaganda ploy than any amount of vituperation in the morning papers. When the United States found itself caught up in the Anglo-French trade wars, which cost it nine hundred ships and plunged its industry into recession, the call for action became irresistible. America declared war in June 1812, and marched into Canada, fulfilling a longstanding urge on the part of the hawks in Congress which they had used the dispute as a pretext to satisfy. In 1814 the British burned down the White House, and though Andrew Jackson&#x2019;s forces won an overwhelming victory at New Orleans in January 1815&#x2014;two weeks after the two countries had signed the Treaty of Ghent, but a month before news of the peace reached American shores&#x2014;the hostilities ended with neither side having achieved its aims. American public opinion, despite near military disaster, rumbles of secession in New England, and awakened nationalism in Canada, saw things differently: the United States had defended its honor against the mighty British Empire, and national pride was noisily on the march.2 All in all, it was not the most propitious time for an English impresario to set out for what was then the wildest west. Drake, like the good pioneer he was, took it all in stride. Early in 1815 he signed up a new recruit, a nineteen-year-old Albany boy named Noah Ludlow, to his fledgling company and sent him on ahead to scout out places to perform along the route. Ludlow, who ran away from home without a word to his family, had set foot on a stage precisely twice in his life, but he had a hunger for the greasepaint. More to the point, Drake had had trouble finding experienced performers who were willing to put their livelihoods&#x2014;maybe even their lives&#x2014;on the line in the untamed wilderness they imagined was waiting out west. To be precise, he had found none at all, for the party that finally got under way comprised Samuel Drake Senior; his sons, Samuel Junior, Alexander, and James; his daughters, Martha and Julia; a carpenter; the carpenter&#x2019;s wife; and a handyman, along with another runaway novice, the daughter of the innkeeper whose hospitality the Drakes had been enjoying, named Fanny Denny. Like the troupe of the great Vincent Crummles in Nicholas Nickleby, whose wife, children, and dog were in the profession and whose chaise-pony went on in Timour the Tartar, the Drakes&#x2019; company was a family affair. Samuel Senior&#x2019;s plan was to lead his myrmidons by land through New York State, take a boat down the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh, and strike out for Kentucky just as the legislature was returning to Frankfort for its winter session. Off they set, forging ahead for a few days and stopping to perform in any barroom or back room where they could rig up a stage. It was a perilous route&#x2014;indeed, somewhere in the rough country between Canandaigua and the headwaters of the Allegheny they briefly lost an actress. Between them the company owned two wagons and three horses: most of the little group had to walk, though the foot soldiers took care to maintain their professional dignity by hanging onto the carts until they were out of town, or by getting up at the crack of dawn to make their escape before anyone was awake to see them. The one-horse wagon belonged to Lewis, the carpenter, and its designated role was to bear the substantial weight of his wife. One day Mrs. Lewis was stricken with cramp and heaved herself out to walk for a while. Soon she was lagging behind, and when she failed to appear around a bend Lewis wheeled back and careened up and down the trail, hollering his wife&#x2019;s name. A couple of strangers rode by and sent for a search party, and actors, strangers, and scouts scattered through the woods, carrying burning torches and calling to the misplaced thespian. By the next morning it was generally concluded that she had been eaten by wild animals, but then another stranger rode up and asked if anyone had lost a woman. A joyful reunion was effected; Mrs. Lewis, no doubt pulling herself up in her grandest tragic style, recounted how she had lost her bearings and wandered off into the woods, where she was forced to haul herself up a tree to avoid being eaten by a pack of wolves. After scaring them off with a volley of twigs she had come upon an empty log cabin, where she tucked into a pot of maple sugar with such gusto that she had been sick, at which point a dog had sniffed her in the act and chased her out into the arms of her savior on his horse. Reading these picaresque tales, as broadly comical as anything in a Henry Fielding novel, it is easy to forget how genuinely dangerous the hardscrabble life of these pioneering actors could be. Fever was rife, the extremes of temperature wreaked havoc with soft constitutions, particularly English ones, and the transportation was bone-rattling at best. As they bumped across the prairies in open wagons, clinging to trunks covered with the skins of circus horses and rubbed so smooth that passengers regularly slid off the side, they must have looked strikingly similar to the strolling players who trudged around England in Shakespeare&#x2019;s time. But their Elizabethan forebears were never called on to cross the frozen Mississippi and watch as their baggage, complete with scenery, props, and the stage curtain, disappeared under a thin patch of ice. That misfortune befell the Jeffersons, another family troupe that followed the Drakes; at the end of their disastrous trek, they were reduced to performing in a pigpen whose regular inhabitants poked their snouts in halfway through and set up a dismal squealing, while a few months later the father of the clan died of yellow fever and his wife, who had once been a popular leading actress, was turned out at the side of a country road, too poor to pay the wagoner for the ride. Theirs was far from the worst fate. In Florida one actor was eaten by wolves, and another troupe was ambushed by Seminole Indians.3 Most escaped to a nearby fort, but two were captured and cut up into pieces. &#x201c;The theatrical wardrobe belonging to the company fell into the hands of the Indians, who, dressing themselves up as Romans, Highlanders, and Shakespearean heroes, galloped about in front of the very fort, though well out of gunshot,&#x201d; one of their more fortunate brethren recorded. In the end several of the ambushers were seized, and &#x201c;as they were robed and decked in the habiliments of Othello, Hamlet, and a host of other Shakespearean characters . . . their identity as the murderers was established, and they were hanged in front of the garrison.&#x201d;4 The Drakes plowed on. When they reached the Allegheny they traded their wagons and horses for a broadhorn boat, a small flat-bottomed vessel with wood plank sides and a roof just above head height. Two cabins were partitioned off, one for Drake and his wife, the second for the other three women: the remaining men begged beds or floor space in farmhouses or barns along the banks, or camped around a fire where, after making a show of home comforts with supper, some coffee, a cigar, and a song, they were kept awake by howling wolves. It was a sultry summer, the water was low and sluggish, and little by&nbsp; little they made their way as well as they could, reading, sewing, or getting stone drunk to pass the time. The calm was punctuated by occasional bursts of excitement&#x2014;one of the company falling overboard from the roof while asleep, an irate shepherd taking potshots at them from the bank after they stole one of his flock, a near fatal encounter with a waterfall after they took the wrong fork in the river&#x2014;but after several months and plenty more adventures they reached Kentucky and opened right on time. There in the Bluegrass State, at the heart of the frontier, the English troupe quickly became a local institution, though the theatre that Noble Luke Usher had talked up turned out to be nothing more than a cramped room above a brewery.

Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.&nbsp;</p><p>Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online.

Among those present was a character entirely new to them, a certain Luci Gribble, whom our leader, in a momentary ambition to reach the status of an &#x2018;entrepreneur&#x2019;, had taken on as Director of Marketing and Administration.</p><p>Mizz Liz Probert, observing the scene, later described Luci (why she had taken to this preposterous spelling of the name of Wordsworth&#x2019;s great love was clear to nobody) as in her thirties, with a &#x2018;short bob&#x2019;, referring to hair which was not necessarily as blonde as it seemed, a thin nose, slightly hooded eyes and a determined chin. She wore a black trouser suit and bracelets clinked at her wrists. The meeting was apparently interrupted from time to time, as she gave swift instructions to the mobile phone she kept in her jacket pocket. She also wore high-heeled black boots which Liz Probert priced at not far short of three hundred pounds.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m vitally concerned with the profile of Equity Court.&#x2019; Luci had a slight northern accent and a way, Liz noticed, of raising her voice at the end of her sentence, so every statement sounded like a question. &#x2018;I take it that it&#x2019;s in the parameters of my job description to include the field of public relations and the all-important question of the company&#x2019;s - that is to say&#x2019; (here Liz swears that Luci corrected herself reluctantly) &#x2018;the <i>Chambers</i>&#x2019; image. Correct, Chair?&#x2019;</p><p>This was an undoubted question, but it seemed to be addressed to an article offurniture, one of that old dining-room set, now much mended and occasionally wobbly, which had been bequeathed to Equity Court in the will of C. H. Wystan, my wife Hilda&#x2019;s father and once Head of our Chambers. However, Soapy Sam Ballard, as ourpresent Head and so chairman of the meeting, appeared to follow the new arrival&#x2019;s drift.</p><p>&#x2018;Of course that&#x2019;s your job, Luci.&#x2019; Soapy Sam was on Christian-name terms with the woman who called him Chair. &#x2018;To improve our image. That&#x2019;s why we hired you. After all, we don&#x2019;t want to be described as a group of old fuddy-duddies, do we?&#x2019; Chair, who might be thought by some to fit the description perfectly, smiled round at the meeting.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s not so much the fuddy-duddy label that concerns me at the moment, although I shall be including that in a future presentation. It&#x2019;s the heartless thing that worries me.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Heartless?&#x2019; Ballard was puzzled.</p><p>&#x2018;The public image of barristers,&#x2019; Luci told the meeting, &#x2018;equals money-grabbing fat cats, insincere defenders of clients who are obviously guilty, chauvinists and outdated wig-wearing shysters.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Did you say &#x201c;shysters&#x201d;?&#x2019; Claude Erskine-Brown, usually mild mannered, ever timid in Court, easily doused by a robust opponent or an impatient Judge, rose in his seat (once again this is the evidence of Liz Probert) and uttered a furious protest. &#x2018;Linsist you withdraw that word &#x201c;shyster&#x201d;.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No need for that, Erskine-Brown.&#x2019; Ballard was being gently judicial. &#x2018;Luci is merely talking us through the public perception.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You put it, Chair, succinctly and to the point.&#x2019; Once again, Luci was grateful to the furniture.</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, well. If it&#x2019;s only the public perception.&#x2019; Erskine-Brown sank back in his seat, apparently mollified.</p><p>&#x2018;What we have to demonstrate is that barristers have outsize hearts. There is no section of the community, and we can prove this by statistics, which cares more deeply, gives more liberally to charity, signs more letters to <i>The Times,</i> and shows its concern for the public good by pointing out more frequent defects in the railway system, than the old-fashioned, tried-and-trusted British barrister.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You can prove anything by statistics.&#x2019; Erskine-Brown was still out, in a small way, to cause trouble.</p><p>&#x2018;Exactly so.&#x2019; Luci seemed unexpectedly delighted. &#x2018;So we have chosen our statistics with great care, and we shall use them to the best possible advantage. But I&#x2019;m not talking statistics here. I&#x2019;m talking of the situation, sad as I&#x2019;m sure we all agree it may be, which gives us the opportunity to show that we do care.&#x2019; Luci paused and seemed, for a moment, moved with deep emotion. &#x2018;So much so that we should all join in a very public display of heartfelt thanks.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Heartfelt thanks for what?&#x2019; Erskine-Brown was mystified. &#x2018;Surely not our legal-aid fees?&#x2019;</p><p>At this point, Luci produced copies of a statement she invited Erskine-Brown to circulate. When Liz Probert got it, she found that it read:</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>We wish to give heartfelt thanks for the life of one of our number. An ordinary, workaday barrister. An old warhorse. One who didn&#x2019;t profess to legal brilliance, but one who cared deeply and whom we loved as a fellow member of number 4 Equity Court.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&#x2018;By this act we shall show that barristers have hearts,&#x2019; Luci summed up the situation.</p><p>&#x2018;By what act is that, exactly?&#x2019; Erskine-Brown was still far from clear.</p><p>&#x2018;The Memorial Service. In the Temple Church for the late Horace Rumpole, barrister at law. Chair, I&#x2019;m sure we can rely on you for a few remarks, giving thanks for a life of quiet and devoted service.&#x2019;</p><p>It later emerged that at this stage of the Chambers meeting Liz Probert, undoubtedly the most sensible member of the gathering, suggested that a discussion of a Memorial Service was a little premature in view of the fact that there had as yet been no announcement of Rumpole&#x2019;s death. Erskine-Brown told her that he had spoken to She Who Must Be Obeyed, who was, he said, &#x2018;putting a brave face on it&#x2019;, but admitted that I had been removed from the hospital to which I had been rushed after a dramatic failure in the ticker department, brought about by an unusually brutal encounter with Judge Ballingham, to the Primrose Path Home in Sussex, and would not be back in Chambers for a very long time indeed. In that case, Liz suggested, all talk of a Memorial Service might be postponed indefinitely.</p><p>&#x2018;Put our programme on hold?&#x2019; Luci was clearly disappointed. &#x2018;It&#x2019;d be a pity not to continue with the planning stage. Naturally, Mrs Rumpole&#x2019;s hoping for the best, but let&#x2019;s face it, at his age Rumpole&#x2019;s actuarial chances of survival are approximate to a negative-risk situation -&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And one knows, doesn&#x2019;t one,&#x2019; Erskine-Brown asked, &#x2018;what places like the Primrose Path are like? They call themselves &#x201c;Homes&#x201d;, but the reality is they are -&#x2019;</p></p><h2>Evangelicals and Catholics Together at Twenty: Vital Statements on Contested Topics</h2><p>Founded by Charles Colson and Richard John Neuhaus in 1994, Evangelicals and Catholics Together (ECT) has fostered a fruitful conversation on the meaning of the gospel in today&#39;s world.

Forever.<p>Timothy Wilde tends bar near the Exchange, saving every dollar and shilling in hopes of winning the girl of his dreams. But when his dreams literally incinerate in a fire devastating downtown Manhattan, he finds himself disfigured, unemployed, and homeless. His older brother obtains Timothy a job in the newly minted NYPD, but he is highly skeptical of this untested "police force."

Instead, he takes her home, where she spins wild stories, claiming that dozens of bodies are buried in the forest north of 23rd Street. Timothy isn't sure whether to believe her or not, but, as the truth unfolds, the reluctant copper star finds himself engaged in a battle for justice that nearly costs him his brother, his romantic obsession, and his own life.</p></p><p><p><b>Amazon Exclusive: Michael Connelly Interviews Lyndsay Faye</b></p> <p><b>Michael Connelly</b>: I think the first question is about the challenge you gave yourself with this book. Re-creating New York City circa 1845. The question I ask is, Why then? But what I am really asking is why you took the difficult path. Why not New York in 1945, or even now? I read this book and from the writer&#x2019;s standpoint, kept asking myself, Why did she take this path? Wow!</p> <p><b>Lyndsay Faye</b>: Ha! Yes, absolutely&#x2014;in a certain sense, the project was very difficult. My hubris in trying to write a novel set in 1845 New York was about the fact that I specifically wanted to do day one, cop one of the NYPD. Origin stories are very compelling. And when you think about how renowned the world over the NYPD is today, for reasons both positive and negative but all of them highly dramatic, you find yourself wondering what such an organization looked like at inception. It&#x2019;s almost mythical, the fame they&#x2019;ve achieved and the advances they&#x2019;ve made, and I was deeply curious to know how they started out. I wanted to take a historical event and turn it into a legend, in the sense of making something iconic and resonant, and when I discovered that the NYPD was founded in 1845, my time period chose itself.</p> <p>In another sense, I should add that I was once on a library panel where a very clever author said we don&#x2019;t write historicals to choose the difficult path, but rather the lazy one. It&#x2019;s almost impossible to commit a decent crime these days, what with CCTV and the Internet and credit-card tracking and forensics and ballistics and security cameras and such everywhere. I have a simple bachelor&#x2019;s in English lit, not an advanced degree in criminal science, and to be honest, I find the complexity of modern-day crime solving much more intimidating when it comes to plot. I know that TV shows like CSI, etc., make it all look more magical than it is in fact, but I&#x2019;m interested in how people solved crimes before forensics was even a line of study. How did the first cops go about it? What tools did they employ? I greatly enjoy reading modern mysteries, but I&#x2019;m constantly staggered by the omnivorous technical know-how they require. </p> <p><b>MC</b>: What&#x2019;s most impressive about this work is how the world of New York is so full and real. Can you walk us through the research that goes into a project like this? How long were you putting this part together before you actually sat down to write the book, or do both things happen at the same time?</p> <p><b>LF</b>: Thank you very much indeed&#x2014;I want all of my historical fiction to be an immersive experience, so to create that effect, I bury myself in the world in question for at least six months before embarking on a first draft. This time around, that meant poring over diaries, setting up my own tent shanty in the New-York Historical Society, camping out with a cookstove in the Bryant Park extension of the New York Public Library&#x2019;s microfilm department, etc. Syntax and fashion and food and architecture and all the other aspects of the culture fascinate me, so I try to soak it all in like a big fluffy pancake. It&#x2019;s irritating for me to be constantly looking up facts or grasping at vernacular as I&#x2019;m writing, so I&#x2019;ve learned to spend half a year at research first. It saves me time in the long run.</p> <p>My research includes history books, always, but original sources are ultimately much more important to me. I read all of the <em>Herald</em> newspaper from January 1st through December 31st for 1845, for instance. Countless people wrote travelogues and social essays and satires in nineteenth-century New York, and those were invaluable. I wanted to know what the people of the time period thought about their city, their politics, their lifestyle. What did they think and say about race? Religion? Where to get the best oyster pie? How that uppity tart cousin of theirs looked at the fireman&#x2019;s ball last night? That journey of discovery is always a fabulous one.</p> <p><b>MC</b>: I think it&#x2019;s easy in a historical novel to make the time and place the star&#x2014;to sort of wow &#x2019;em with your research. That usually leaves the story short on character. You escaped that pitfall with a host of characters, leading with Timothy Wilde. It seems that equal preparation went into Wilde as did into your historical research. Can you say where Wilde comes from?</p> <p><b>LF</b>: See, this is something I love talking about, because historical fiction that shows off the research involved rather dismays me. The author presents you with a narrator who is, for example, a tavern girl. She&#x2019;s plucky and wonderful and when running for her life from sinister guardsmen, she stops to tell you that the building she&#x2019;s racing past was erected in 1814, by whom, with what variety of stone. I&#x2019;m exaggerating, but I make it a principle not to include any information that my characters wouldn&#x2019;t find relevant. Or I try my best to avoid it.</p> <p>So it&#x2019;s very fair to say that as much effort goes into my characters as into the world around them. Tim is culled from multiple sources. To name a few, when I realized that the early NYPD was inextricably tied up in politics, I determined that I wanted him to be an outsider with his own set of principles, yet I still wanted him to be highly competent. I was in the restaurant business for ten years; my husband and many of my closest friends are bartenders, and you ought to be aware that they know more about you than you suppose. Barkeeps are keen observers, and I realized that a former career in an oyster cellar would be grand training for the NYPD. Tim&#x2019;s physical appearance is more or less based on a dear actor friend of mine I used to work with when I did musical theater. Many bits of Timothy are, of course, me. Fountains that don&#x2019;t work make me irrationally annoyed; they annoy Tim, too. Finally, my favorite aspects of Tim are those sort of alchemical moments when a character you&#x2019;re imagining takes on a life of his or her own.</p> <p><b>MC</b>: It was pure genius to anchor this story in two significant events&#x2014;the potato famine and the founding of the New York Police Department. There is probably substantial documentation of these two things. How do you take them and blend them into fiction? Were you a slave to drama or a slave to the facts/truths of that time? </p> <p><b>LF</b>: The historical confluence of the Great Famine and the inaugural year of the NYPD was a gift of twenty-four-karat writerly gold. If I&#x2019;d found a genie on a beach and asked it for ideal dramatic material, I couldn&#x2019;t have done better. That was 100 percent luck, actually&#x2014;I was researching the first cops, and then I found that the potato blight had just been discovered the previous year in Europe, and that thousands upon thousands of Irish were fleeing their homeland. &#x201c;Native&#x201d; New Yorkers were up in arms about emigrants ruining their democracy in the name of the Antichrist of Rome, all that unfortunate hyperbolic political grandstanding that happens when too many people want the same resources. It was total chaos, and it changed the face New York City society.</p> <p>Blending the stories of the copper stars and of the emigrants was a challenge, but a riveting one for me. As you say, both the potato famine and the first police force are well documented. I was a slave to the facts in the sense that I wanted to do as much justice as possible to my ancestors, who were seeking new lives in what turned out to be a hostile environment. The influx of Irish refugees continued for quite some time, so I&#x2019;d copious material to cull from. It became very real for me. The chapter titles all feature a quote from the time period, for instance, to help us bear in mind that poverty and religious bigotry and corruption were rampant and real. The thin line between success and despair they walked is as shocking and relevant today as it was then, so by virtue of being a slave to the facts, I managed to be a slave to the drama simultaneously. </p> <p><b>MC</b>: Your last novel, <em>Dust and Shadow</em>, also blended fiction and fact&#x2014;Jack the Ripper&#x2014;and historical research. Aside from these two very large, real events that we start with in <em>TGOG</em>, was there a smaller, true incident that inspired this story?</p> <p><b>LF</b>: Yes, indeed. The story of Eliza Rafferty and her infanticide was entirely true&#x2014;it took place in 1849 in a house at number 6 Doyer Street. When I read about her distress and incomprehension after killing her own child, I set myself the gruesome task of finding out what sort of life could inspire such an act. The neighbors were rightly shocked by the baby&#x2019;s death, the police appalled. Today I think we&#x2019;d term her state a psychotic form of severe postpartum depression, but apart from lacking modern medicine to save her and her child, she probably lacked everything else as well&#x2014;ample space, adequate food, any sort of safety net whatsoever. As Tim&#x2019;s introduction to the atrocities a policeman must face in order to do his job, it&#x2019;s horrifying but also immediately brings home how high the stakes are going to be. </p> <p><b>MC</b>: Here&#x2019;s one I bet you never saw coming. (Not really.) What is next for you? Will you stay with a historical project?</p> <p><b>LF</b>: Yes, I&#x2019;m thick in the sequel to <em>Gotham</em>! It takes place six months later, in the winter of 1846. Timothy and Valentine have quite a bit of baggage to work through, after all, so I think it would be rather cruel not to give them a shot. The usual suspects will be back in force, and writing it has been a fantastic experience. I&#x2019;ve never written a sequel before. Wish me luck!

Eclectic. Sexy. And influential. One could call them the first divas--and they ran absolutely wild. They were poets, actresses, singers, artists, journalists, publishers, baronesses, and benefactresses. They were thinkers and they were drinkers. They eschewed the social conventions expected of them--to be wives and mothers--and decided to live on their own terms. In the process, they became the voices of a new, fierce feminine spirit.<br><br>There's Mina Loy, a modernist poet and much-photographed beauty who traveled in pivotal international art circles; blues divas Bessie Smith and Ethel Waters; Edna St. Vincent Millay, the lyric poet who, with her earthy charm and passion, embodied the '20s ideal of sexual daring; the avant-garde publishers Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap; and the wealthy hostesses of the salons, A'Lelia Walker and Mabel Dodge. Among the supporting cast are Emma Goldman, Isadora Duncan, Ma Rainey, Margaret Sanger, and Gertrude Stein.<br><br>Andrea Barnet's fascinating accounts of the emotional and artistic lives of these women--together with rare black-and-white photographs, taken by photographers such as Berenice Abbott and Man Ray--capture the women in all their glory.<br><br> This is a history of the early feminists who didn't set out to be feminists, a celebration of the rebellious women who paved the way for future generations.</p><p>Born in Boston, Massachusetts, and educated at the University of Pennsylvania and at Harvard, Andrea Barnet has been a regular reviewer for the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> since 1985. Her articles on art and culture have appeared in <i>Smithsonian Magazine, Harper's Bazaar, Mirabella, Working Mother, Avenue,</i> and <i>Architectural Record.</i> She lives in New York City and is married to the painter Kit White. They have one daughter.With a neatly composed set of intersecting biographies, journalist Barnet engagingly illustrates the extraordinary period of cultural freedom for American women that came after whalebone corsets of the Victorian era were loosed and before the privations of the Depression sucked the gumption out of the nation. Barnet uses New York as the red-hot locus where these women met, mingled, made love and made art. At the book's heart are eight creators. In Greenwich Village, modernist poet and artist Mina Loy wrote her manifesto "Aphorisms on Futurism." Nearby, the winsome Edna St. Vincent Millay burned her candle at both ends in a cold-water flat, breaking cultural rules and several suitors' hearts. Editors and lovers Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap constructed the influential arts magazine Little Review, which climaxed with the serial publication of Joyce's Ulysses. Uptown, in Harlem, blues divas like the wild Bessie Smith and coy Ethel Waters crooned to audiences of blacks and whites alike. A'Lelia Walker, the richest black woman in America, hosted a salon where, "besides the usual throng of artists, dancers, jazz musicians, poets, journalists, critics, and novelists, one might see English Rothschilds, French princesses, Russian grand dukes, mobsters, prizefighters, men of the stock exchange and Manhattan's social elite, elegant homosexuals, Village bohemians, white movie celebrities, and smartly dressed employees of the U.S. Post Office." Barnet's treatment of this scintillating era is as lively and appealing as the women she's writing about. B&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Elizabeth Goeters, Georgia Perimeter Coll., Dunwoody <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.Despite the imagery from the serene, earthy Renaissance Madonna to Madonna Ciccone motherhood is not always the blissful idyll that our culture would have us believe. New mothers often feel overwhelmed and frustrated, working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for no pay and little respect. Depression is so common in mothers of infants that the American Psychological Association considers young motherhood a risk factor for depression. University of New Hampshire psychologist and postpartum depression expert Kathleen A. Kendall-Tackett helps mothers explore negative feelings and cope with them in The Hidden Feelings of Motherhood: Coping with Stress, Depression and Burnout.

It was to turn into one of the most breathtaking survival stories of all time. Even as they coasted down the channel, Shackleton wired back to London to offer his ship to the war effort. The reply came from the First Lord of the Admiralty, one Winston Churchill: &#34;Proceed.&#34; And proceed they did. When the Endurance was trapped and finally crushed to splinters by pack ice in late 1915, they drifted on an ice floe for five months, before getting to open sea and launching three tiny boats as far as the inhospitable, storm-lashed Elephant Island. They drank seal oil and ate baby albatross (delicious, apparently). From there Shackelton himself and seven others - the author among them - went on, in a 22-foot open boat, for an unbelievable 800 miles, through the Antarctic seas in winter, to South Georgia and rescue. It is an extraordinary story of courage and even good-humour among men who must have felt certain, secretly, that they were going to die. Worsley&#39;s account, first published in 1940, captures that bulldog spirit exactly: uncomplaining, tough, competent, modest and deeply loyal. It&#39;s gripping, and strangely moving.</p><p>Frank A. Worsley, a native New Zealander, served as a reserve officer in the Royal Navy before becoming captain of the Endurance. His navigation skills were crucial to the eventua survival of the crew. He died in 1943. He commanded two ships in World War I, for which he was decorated, sailed with Shackleton again in 1921, and in 1925 was the joint leader of the British Arctic Exploration. Worsley died in 1943."The Weddell Sea might be described as the Antarctic extension of the South Atlantic Ocean. Near the southern extreme of the Weddell Sea in 77� south latitude Shackleton's ship Endurance, under my command, was beset in heavy pack ice. The temperature in February fell to 53� of frost - an unusually cold snap for the southern summer of 1914-15. <p>"The pack ice froze into a solid mass. We were unable to free the ship and she drifted northwest, 1,000 miles during the summer, autumn, and winter. The Endurance was crushed, and sank in 69� S. </p><p>"Our party of twenty-eight - eleven scientists and seventeen seamen - camped on the floes in lightweight tents through which the sun and moon shone and the blizzards chilled us. Our main food supply consisted of seals and penguins. So the ice, with its human freight, crept northwards - 600 miles in five months." </p><p>These are the dramatic opening words of Frank Worsley's gripping adventure story, hardly hinted at by his book's unassuming title, Shackleton's Boat Journey. Worsley was the captain of the Endurance, and the matter-of-fact tone that pervades this book serves to heighten rather than diminish the astounding accomplishments of Ernest Shackleton and his crew, who were attempting an Antarctic Expedition. </p><p>When the Endurance became trapped, the task of the expedition changed from one of exploration to one of survival. Manning the three lifeboats, the crew attempted to reach land, but their way was blocked by the same sort of ice that had just crushed the Endurance. They were forced to set up camp on giant ice floes, and remained drifting for five months. (Worsley charted the drift, and if they moved toward Elephant Island, he was praised, if they did not, he was cursed.) They faced the cold, killer whales, and despair, but the greatest danger was that of losing a man in the water: </p><p>"The nor'west swell rolled our ice floe to and fro, rocking us gently to sleep. Slowly the floe swung round until it was end on to the swell. The watchmen, discussing the respective merits of seal brains and livers, ignored this challenge of the swell. At 11 P.M. a larger undulation rolled beneath, lifting the floe and cracking it across under the seamen's tent. We heard a shout, and rushing out found their tent was tearing in halves - one half on our side and half on the other side of the crack." </p><p>In spite of the darkness, Sir Ernest, by some instinct, knew the right spot to go to. He found Holness - like a full-grown Moses - in his bag in the sea. Sir Ernest leaned over, seized the bag and, with one mighty effort, hove man and bag up on to the ice. Next second the halves of the floe swung together in the hollow of the swell with a thousand-ton blow. </p><p>The first part of Worsley's book chronicles the final push to the nearest land, Elephant Island, situated in the Antarctic Archipelago that reaches out into the South Sea. Shackleton then made the decision to take five men with him in one of the boats and try for South Georgia Island, a journey of over 800 miles of open sea. Worsley was chosen for his navigational skills. The latter part of the book describes their sixteen days at sea and arrival at the uninhabited side of the island. Shackleton, Worsley and Crean were forced to make a further push inland over dangerous mountainous terrain in order to reach help. </p><p>What enabled the men to persevere? Not just the incredible courage, humor, and dedication to one another that they displayed, but also an innate sense of how decent men behave. To get the entire picture of Worsley's character, however, you have to read Shackleton's account of the adventure in South (available from The Narrative Press); Worsley is too modest to put himself forward. This is an exceptional story.</p></p><h2>Soul Mind Body Science System: Grand Unification Theory and Practice for Healing, Rejuvenation, Longevity, and Immortality</h2><p><b>What is a soul?

At once I say I am feeling unwell, and send all my women away. We are alone in my privy chamber and I let him take a stool and sit opposite me, almost as an equal.<br>&#x2018;The Queen Elizabeth summoned me to sanctuary last night and she was distraught,&#x2019; he says quietly.<br>&#x2018;She was?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;She had been told that the princes were dead, and she was begging me to tell her that it was not the case.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;What did you say?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t know what you would have me say. So I told her what everyone in the City is saying: that they are dead. That Richard had them killed either on the day of his coronation, or as he left London.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;And she?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;She was deeply shocked; she could not believe it.

But what did she mean?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s what I asked her.

I asked her if Prince Richard was not in the Tower when the two boys were killed? She just said that I was to ask you to put your own guards into the Tower to keep her son safe. She would say nothing more. She sent me away.&#x2019;<br>I rise from my stool.

How does she always do it? How is it that when she is brought so low that I can even bring myself to pray for her, she manages to turn her fortunes around? It must be witchcraft; it can only be witchcraft. Her happiness and her success have haunted my life. I know her to be in league with the devil, for sure. I wish he would take her to hell.<br>&#x2018;You will have to go back to her,&#x2019; I say, turning to him.<br>He almost looks as if he would refuse.<br>&#x2018;What?&#x2019; I snap.<br>&#x2018;Lady Margaret, I swear, I dread going to her. She is like a witch imprisoned in the cleft of a pine tree, she is like an entrapped spirit, she is like a water goddess on a frozen lake, waiting for spring. She lives in the gloom of sanctuary with the river flowing all the time beside their rooms and she listens to the babble as a counsellor. She knows things that she cannot know by earthly means. She fills me with terror. And her daughter is as bad.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You will have to summon your courage,&#x2019; I say briskly. &#x2018;Be brave, you are doing God&#x2019;s work. You have to go back to her and tell her to be of stout heart. Tell her that I am certain that the princes are alive. Remind her that when we attacked the Tower we heard the guards taking them back from the door. They were alive then, why would Richard kill them now? Richard has taken the throne without killing them, why would he put them to death now? Richard is a man who does his own work and he is hundreds of miles away from them now. Tell her I will double my people in the Tower and that I swear to her, on my honour, that I will protect them. Remind her that the uprising will start next month. As soon as we defeat Richard the king, we will set the boys free. Then, when she is reassured, when she is in her first moment of relief, when you see the colour come to her face and you have convinced her &#x2013; in that moment quickly ask her if she has her son Prince Richard in safety already? If she has him hidden away somewhere?&#x2019;<br>He nods, but he is pale with fear. &#x2018;And are they safe?&#x2019; he asks. &#x2018;Can I truly assure her that those poor boys are safe and we will rescue them? That the rumours, even in your own household, are false? Do you know if they are they alive or dead, Lady Margaret? Can I tell their mother that they are alive and speak the truth?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;They are in the hands of God,&#x2019; I reply steadily. &#x2018;As are we all. My son too. These are dangerous times, and the princes are in the hands of God.&#x2019;<br><br>That night we hear news of the first uprising. It is mistimed, it comes too early. The men of Kent are marching on London, calling on the Duke of Buckingham to take the throne. The county of Sussex gets up in arms, believing they cannot delay a moment longer, and the men of Hampshire beside them rise up too, as a fire will leap from one dry woodland to another. Richard&#x2019;s most loyal commander, Thomas Howard, the brand new Duke of Norfolk, marches down the west road from London, and occupies Guildford, fighting skirmishes to the west and to the east, but holding the rebels down in their own counties, and sending a desperate warning to the king: the counties of the south are up in the name of the former Queen and her imprisoned sons, the princes.<br>Richard, the battle-hardened leader of York, marches south at the fast speed of a York army, makes his centre of command at Lincoln, and raises troops in every county, especially from those who greeted his progress with such joy. He hears of the betrayal of the Duke of Buckingham when men come from Wales to tell him that the duke is already on the march, going north through the Welsh marches, recruiting men and clearly planning to cross at Gloucester, or perhaps Tewkesbury, to come into the heart of England with his own men and his Welsh recruits. His beloved friend, Henry Stafford, is marching out under his standard, as proudly and as bravely as once he did for Richard; only now he is marching against him.<br>Richard goes white with rage and he grips his right arm, his sword arm, above the elbow, as if he were shaking with rage, as if to hold it steady. &#x2018;A man with the best cause to be true,&#x2019; he exclaims. &#x2018;The most untrue creature living. A man who had everything he asked for. Never was a false traitor better treated; a traitor, a traitor.&#x2019;<br>At once he sends out commissions of array to every county in England demanding their loyalty, demanding their arms and their men. This is the first and greatest crisis of his new reign. He summons them to support a York king, he demands the loyalty that they gave to his brother, which they have all promised to him. He warns those who cheered when he took the crown less than sixteen weeks ago that they must now stand by that decision, or England will fall to an unholy alliance of the false Duke of Buckingham, the witch queen, and the Tudor pretender.<br>It is pouring with rain, and there is a strong wind blowing hard from the north. It is unnatural weather, witch&#x2019;s weather. My son must set sail now, if he is to arrive while the queen&#x2019;s supporters are up, and while Buckingham is marching. But if it is so foul here, in the south of England, then I fear the weather in Brittany. He must come at exactly the right moment to catch the weary victor of the first battle and make them turn and fight again, while they are sick of fighting. But &#x2013; I stand at my window and watch the rain pouring down, and the wind lashing the trees in our garden &#x2013; I know he cannot set sail in this weather, the wind is howling towards the south, I cannot believe he will even be able to get out of port.<br><br>The next day the rains are worse and the river is starting to rise. It is over our landing steps at the foot of the garden and the boatmen drag the Stanley barge up the garden to the very orchard, out of the swirling flood, fearing that it will be torn from its moorings by the current. I can&#x2019;t believe that Henry can set sail in this, and even if he were to get out of harbour, I can&#x2019;t believe that he could safely get across the English seas to the south coast. <br>My web of informers, spies and plotters are stunned by the ferocity of the rain, which is like a weapon against us. The roads into London are all but impassable; no-one can get a message through. A horse and rider cannot get from London to Guildford, and as the river rises higher, there is news of flooding and drowning upstream and down. The tides are unnaturally high and every day and night the floods from the river pour down to the inrushing tide and there is a boiling surge of water which wipes out riverside houses, quays, piers and docks. Nobody can remember weather like this, a rain storm which lasts for days, and the rivers are bursting their banks all around England.<br>I have no-one to talk to but my God, and I cannot always hear His voice, as if the rain is blotting out His very face, and the wind blowing away His words. This is how I know for sure that it is a witch&#x2019;s wind. I spend my day at the window overlooking the garden, watching the river boil over the garden wall and come up through the orchard, lap by lap, till the trees themselves seem to be stretching up to the heavy clouds for help. Whenever one of my ladies comes to my side, or Dr Lewis comes to my door, or any of the plotters in London ask for admittance, they all want to know what is happening: as if I know any more than them, when all I can hear is rain, as if I can foretell the future in the galeripped sky. But I know nothing, anything could be happening out there; a waterlogged massacre could be taking place even half a mile away, and none of us would know. We would hear no voices over the sound of the storm, no lights would show through the rain.<br>I spend my nights in my chapel, praying for the safety of my son and the success of our venture, and hearing no answer from God but only the steady hammer of the torrent on the roof and the whine of the wind lifting the slates above me, until I think that God Himself has been blotted from the heavens of England by the witch&#x2019;s wind, and I will never hear Him again.<br>Finally, I get a letter from my husband at Coventry.<br><br><i>The king has commanded my presence and I fear he doubts me. He has sent for my son Lord Strange too, and was very dark when he learned that my son is from his home with an army of ten thousand men on the march, but my son has told nobody where he is going, and his servants only swear that he said he was raising his men for the true cause. I assure the king that my son will be marching to join us, loyal to the throne; but he has not yet arrived here at our command centre, in Coventry Castle.<br>Buckingham is trapped in Wales by the rising of the river Severn. Your son, I believe, will be held in port by the storm on the seas. The queen&#x2019;s men will be unable to march out on the drowned roads and the Duke of Norfolk is waiting for </i><i>them. I think your rebellion is over, you have been beaten by the rain and the rising of the waters. They are calling it the Duke of Buckingham&#x2019;s Water and it has washed him and his ambition to hell along with your hopes. Nobody has seen a storm like this since the Queen Elizabeth called up a mist to hide her husband&#x2019;s army at the battle of Barnet, or summoned snow for him at Tewkesbury. Nobody doubts she can do such a thing and most of us only hope she will stop before she washes us all away. But why? Can she be working against you now? And if so, why? Does she know, with her inner sight, what has befallen her boys and who has done it? Does she think you have done it? Is she drowning your son in revenge?<br>Destroy what papers you have kept, and deny whatever you have done. Richard is coming to London for his revenge and there will be a scaffold built on Tower Green. If he believes half what he has heard he will put you on it and I will be unable to save you.<br>Stanley.<br><br></i>OCTOBER 1483<br><br>I have been on my knees all night, but I don&#x2019;t know if God can hear me through the hellish noise of the rain. My son sets sail from Brittany with fifteen valuable ships and an army of five thousand men and loses them all in the storm at sea. Only two ships struggle ashore on the south coast and learn at once that Buckingham has been defeated by the rising of the river, his rebellion is washed away by the waters, and Richard is waiting, dry-shod, to execute the survivors.<br>My son turns his back on the country that should have been his, and sails for Brittany again, flying like a faintheart, leaving me here, unprotected, and clearly guilty of plotting his rebellion. We are parted once more, my heir and I, this time without even meeting, and this time it feels as if it is for ever. He and Jasper leave me to face the king, who marches vengefully on London like an invading enemy, mad with anger. Dr Lewis vanishes off to Wales, Bishop Morton takes the first ship that can sail after the storms and goes to France, Buckingham&#x2019;s men slip from the City in silence and under lowering skies, the queen&#x2019;s kin make their way to Brittany and to the tattered remains of my son&#x2019;s makeshift court, and my husband arrives in London in the train of King Richard, whose handsome face is dark with the sullen rage of a traitor betrayed. <br>&#x2018;He knows,&#x2019;my husband says shortly as he comes to my room, his travelling cape still around his shoulders, his sympathy scant. &#x2018;He knows you were working with the queen, and he will put you on trial. He has evidence from half a dozen witnesses. Rebels from Devon to East Anglia know your name and have letters from you.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Husband, surely he will not.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You are clearly guilty of treason and that is punishable by death.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;But if he thinks you are faithful . . .&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I <i>am </i>faithful,&#x2019; he corrects me. &#x2018;It is not a matter of opinion but of fact. Not what the king thinks &#x2013; but what he can see. When Buckingham rode out, while you were summoning your son to invade England, and paying rebels, while the queen was raising the southern counties, I was at his side, advising him, loaning him money, calling out my own affinity to defend him, faithful as any northerner. He trusts me now as he has never done before. My son raised an army for him.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Your son&#x2019;s army was for me!&#x2019; I interrupt.<br>&#x2018;My son will deny that, I will deny that, we will call you a liar and nobody can prove anything, either way.&#x2019;<br>I pause. &#x2018;Husband, you will intercede for me?&#x2019;<br>He looks at me thoughtfully, as if the answer could be &#x2018;no&#x2019;.<br>&#x2018;Well, it is a consideration, Lady Margaret. My King Richard is bitter, he cannot believe that the Duke of Buckingham, his best friend, his only friend, should betray him. And you? He is astonished at your infidelity. You carried his wife&#x2019;s train at her coronation, you were her friend, you welcomed her to London. He feels you have betrayed him. Unforgiveably. He thinks you as faithless as your kinsman Buckingham; and Buckingham was executed on the spot.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Buckingham is dead?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;They took off his head in Salisbury market place. The king would not even see him. He was too angry with him and he is filled with hate towards you. You said that Queen Anne was welcome to her city, that she had been missed. You bowed the knee to him and wished him well. And then you sent out messages to every disaffected Lancastrian family in the country to tell them the cousins&#x2019; war had come again, and that this time you will win.&#x2019;<br>I grit my teeth. &#x2018;Should I run away? Should I go to Brittany too?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;My dear, how ever would you get there?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I have my money chest, I have my guard. I could bribe a ship to take me, if I went down to the docks at London now, I could get away. Or Greenwich. Or I could ride to Dover or Southampton . . .&#x2019;<br>He smiles at me and I remember they call him &#x2018;the fox&#x2019; for his ability to survive, to double back, to e...</p><h2>NRSV Wesley Study Bible - Green/Brown Faux Leather Edition: New Revised Standard Version</h2><p>Love God with a warmed heart.

Fortune presents a clear discussion, sweeping aside our cultural assumptions and stereotypes. She is able to place occultism in its proper place asa philosophy that employs scientific and rational methodology to explore the meaning of life, while retaining religious overtones. She reveals the heart of occult ethics and ideals that occult research seeks to aid people in achieving enlightenment.</p></p><p>A must read for students of the Western Mystery Tradition!<p>First published in 1929 (under the title Sane Occultism), this volume is as useful and pertinent now as it was then. this edition, with a comprehensive, context-setting Introduction by Gareth Knight, places occultism in its proper place as a philosophy that employs rational methodology to explore the meaning of life. Fortune offers the reader an in-depth look at what occultism can be to the rational and well-trained practitioner. She explains how occultism moves a step beyond both physical sciences and psychology, allowing the seeker to be guided by rational, measured investigation of psychic experience. Her discussion of the left-hand path, psychic pathologies, and mental trespassing are invaluable knowledge for the reader threader who is beginning a personal exploration of the occult.

She conveys a firm, unshakable belief in the existence of evil-personal, psychological, and political. . . . The genius of Tales-and of all Highsmith's writing-is that it is at once deeply disturbing and exhilarating."-Michael Bronski, The Boston Phoenix <p>In this eerily up-to-date collection, Highsmith's incisive prose chronicles a world gone slightly mad, its catastrophes precipitated by human folly and excess. From the White House under siege by the homeless to a 190-year-old woman perpetually near death and dimly glowing, each tale unfolds the illogical extremes of humanity in the late twentieth century. Highsmith transmogrifies the face of daily existence to lay bare its manifold dark motives. These stories leave us haunted with "afterimages that will tremble-but stay-in our minds" (The New Yorker). </p><p>"The stories are flush with satire, mischief and menace. Hers is a world consumed by self-destruction, driven by stupidity, greed and self-interest-a place where the human race cannibalizes its own. . . . [Her stories] unsettle the soul and dampen the palms."-Jill Pearlman, Harper's Bazaar </p><p>Patricia Highsmith (1921-1995), an American who lived most of her life in Europe, was the author of such classic suspense novels as Strangers on a Train (made into a film by Alfred Hitchcock, with a screenplay by Raymond Chandler), The Talented Mr. Ripley (awarded both the Grand Prix de Littrature Policire and the Edgar Allan Poe Scroll by the Mystery Writers of America), The Cry of the Owl, Found in the Street, Those Who Walk Away, The Two Faces of January (winner of the Crime Writers Association of Great Britain's first prize for best foreign novel), A Game for the Living, Edith's Diary, and seven collections of short stories, including Eleven and Tales of Natural and Unnatural Catastrophes.</p>Patricia Highsmith was born in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1921. Her first novel, Strangers On A Train, was made into a film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1951. The Talented Mr Ripley, published in 1955, was awarded the Edgar Allan Poe Scroll by the Mystery Writers of America and introduced the fascinating anti-hero Tom Ripley, who was to appear in many of her later crime novels. Patricia Highsmith died in Locarno, Switzerland, in February 1995. Her last novel, Small g: A Summer Idyll, was published posthumously just over a month later.</p><h2>Life Goes on</h2><p><p>Pastor Sam Gardner is back in his fourth year serving the eccentric Quaker community of Harmony, Indiana, which continues to bustle with gossip, scandals, and small-town fervor. This year, the Sausage Queen is impeached after a shocking revelation, plunging the town into anarchy as her many and varied responsibilities go unmet. Dale Hinshaw gets his comeuppance when his wife, Dolores, hits the road, leaving Sam to cook Dale's food and do his laundry. With a new doctor in town, Deena Morrison's days of spinsterhood might be drawing to a close, while the Friendly Women's Circle beseeches the Lord for new kitchen cabinets.</p><p>Amidst the surprising and annoying struggles of his congregants, Sam's commitment is put to the test. As he sits in the empty meetinghouse on a snowy Sunday, Sam wrestles with what it means to faithfully preach the gospel to this community. He becomes even more endearing as he faithfully seeks to serve his quirky flock.</p><p>A masterful storyteller who peppers his narrative with profound spiritual truths in the most natural way, Gulley has created a fictional world that will quickly become a welcome refuge.</p></p><p><p>Philip Gulley is a Quaker minister, writer, husband, and father. He is the bestselling author of <em>Front Porch Tales</em>, the acclaimed Harmony series, and is coauthor of <em>If Grace Is True</em> and <em>If God Is Love</em>. Gulley lives with his wife and two sons in Indiana, and is a frequent speaker at churches, colleges, and retreat centers across the country.</p>Like <i>Signs and Wonders</i>, the previous book in the popular series featuring Pastor Sam Gardner and the colorful parishioners of the Harmony Friends Meeting in Harmony, Ind., Gulley's fourth installment unfolds through a series of warm, lightly comic anecdotes. Readers will know they're in cozily familiar territory from the get-go, when Dale Hinshaw&#x2014;the vigilant, long-winded, self-appointed guardian of doctrinal purity&#x2014;seizes an opportunity to take the pulpit on Easter Sunday (Pastor Sam has laryngitis) and rant for 45 minutes without a single mention of the Resurrection. As the book strolls along, Sam presides over a funeral for a fellow who&#x2014;oops!&#x2014;isn't dead, experiences a couple of home-repair mishaps, gets validated for another year of preaching, contracts head lice and bemusedly recounts the antics of his fellow citizens. Tiffany Nagel, the "Sausage Queen," is unmasked as a vegetarian; the town's 29-year-old spinster, Deena Morrison, finally meets her Prince Charming thanks to ringworm; and Dale Hinshaw keeps causing trouble, even for his own wife. By the time December rolls around, Pastor Sam is fed up with every "narrow-minded kook" in town, and it's time for some soul-searching and a re-evaluation of his job as pastor&#x2014;if those kooks don't get him fired first. This is sweet, homespun storytelling, as comfy and reassuring as warm socks in a wet spring. Gulley's growing number of fans will relish this funny and occasionally hokey novel. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As he told me on more than one occasion, he had every intention of bringing out another edition. In Marc Bloch's own mind this was not simply a matter of reissuing the original text. He knew, none better, that time stops for no historian, that every good piece of historical writing needs to be rewritten after twenty years: otherwise the writer has failed in his objective, failed to goad others into testing his foundations and improving on his rasher hypotheses by subjecting them to greater precision. Marc Bloch was not given time to refashion his great book as he would have wished. One wonders whether he would in fact ever have brought himself to do it. I have the impression that the prospect of this somewhat dreary and certainly difficult task (however one may try to avoid it, revision of an earlier work is always hampered by the original design, which offers few easy loopholes for escape) held less appeal than the excitement of conceiving and executing an entirely new book. However this may be, our friend has carried this secret, with so many others, to his grave. The fact remains that one of our historical classics, now more than twenty years old, is due for republication and is here presented to the reader.</p><p>"Colorfully written. . . his book opens new avenues of historical investigation beyond the usual legal, institutions, or purely economic approach to agrarian history. . . .His work has remained a classic of its kind for over three decades."--<i>Choice</i>&nbsp;"Bryce Lyon is inclined to believe that FRENCH RURAL HISTORY is Bloch's real masterpiece--a book that 'revolutionized the study of agrarian history and transformed many previous studies into museum pieces.'

Set in Botswana in the days before the end of apartheid, Norman Rush's novel is, essentially, a comedy of manners played out in Austen's approved milieu: a country village. Granted, the village in question, Tsau, is a utopian society created by the great American anthropologist Nelson Denoon, and run largely by and for disenfranchised and abused African women. Still, the issue that interests Rush (and the one that fueled Austen's novels) is the age-old question of who mates with whom, and why? The unnamed narrator is a 32-year-old postgraduate student in anthropology whose dissertation has just gone south on her. Drifting around the edges of the expatriate community in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, she first meets Denoon: <blockquote> He was smiling at Kgosetlemang--the event was to be considered over with, clearly--and I could tell that his gingivae were as good as mine; which is saying a lot. I attend to my gums. People in the bush don't always attend to their oral hygiene, not to mention other niceties. There was no sign of that here. I of course am fanatical about my gums because my idea of what the movie <i>I Wake Up Screaming</i> is about is a woman who has to keep dating to find her soulmate and she's had to get dentures. I have very long-range anxieties. </blockquote> Entranced by this potential soulmate, our heroine strikes out into the Kalahari Desert with a couple of donkeys and follows him to his utopia where sexual attraction, regional politics, and social experimentation make for very strange bedfellows, indeed. <p> <i>Mating</i> is a fiercely intelligent, hugely ambitious novel that takes on feminism, socialism, political corruption, foreign-sponsored rural development projects, and, yes, male-female relations in ways that are simultaneously hilarious and disturbing. Certainly Rush's language is a big part of what makes the novel work: the narrator's combination of elevated vocabulary and wacky non sequiturs is inspired. When, for example, Denoon explains to her that most of the women in Tsau are celibate and therefore so is he, she reflects that "of course the spiritus rector of a female community would need to be a sexual solitary, at least during the foundational period." She then wonders if "this situation was the analog of western series on television where the female watchership shrank to nothing when the producers let the marshal get married." <i>Mating</i> is remarkable for its wit, its acuity, and its ability to satirize without demeaning; it's also a heck of an entertaining story.

'Tis a pity they know their own worth, fer it makes 'em difficult to bargain with. Shrewd they are; 'tis rare they come out on the bottom side of any bargain. Yer own pa says he'd rather be bit by a sheep than dicker with a MacLean.</i> </p><p> </p><blockquote> Old Woman Nora of Loch Lomond to her three wee granddaughters one cold night </blockquote> <p> </p><p> </p><p> <i></i></p><blockquote><i> Gretna Green, Scotland<p> April 9, 1807 </p></i></blockquote> <p> Fiona MacLean forced herself to smile. "Father MacCanney, we've come to be married." </p><p> The heavyset priest looked uncertainly from Fiona to the groom and then back. "B-but -- he's not -- I canna -- " </p><p> "Yes you can, Father," Fiona said in her calmest voice, her hands fiercely fisted in the strings of her reticule. </p><p> Come hell or high water, she was about to end the longest, most drawn-out, and most foolish feud in all Scotland. And thereby lose her freedom, her carefully planned future, and perhaps even a bit of her heart. </p><p> The thought made her stomach sink lower. But this marriage was necessary if she wished to keep her brothers safe from their own foolish tempers. <i>It's the only way. I cannot waver.</i> </p><p> "Fiona, lass," Father MacCanney said in an exasperated voice, "he's not fit to be a groom!" </p><p> "All the more reason for me to marry the fool." At the priest's blink of surprise, she quickly added, "'Tis a known fact that a good woman can turn even the most contrary, rotten, stubborn ne'er-do-well into a responsible man." </p><p> The priest glanced uneasily at her prospective groom. "Aye, but -- " </p><p> "Have no fear for me, Father. I know he's no prize, but he's the one I want." </p><p> "Fiona, I know the lad might benefit from the match. 'Tis just -- " </p><p> "I know," she said, sighing bravely. "He's a philanderer who's been with every woman from the North Sea to the fleshpots of London." </p><p> The priest flushed at the mention of fleshpots. "Yes, yes. So everyone knows, but -- " </p><p> "He is also a complete wastrel who has made no effort to embrace a useful life. I know he's not the best choice of groom, but -- " </p><p> "He's not even conscious!" the priest burst out. "He canna even say his own name!" </p><p> Fiona glanced down to where her man, Hamish, had dropped her groom on the cold flagstone at her feet. Muddy rivulets dripped onto the church floor from Kincaid's clothing. "I was afraid that was your problem." Even unconscious, Jack was a royal pain. Some things never changed. </p><p> "Lassie, ye canna drag an unconscious man to the altar." </p><p> "Why not?" </p><p> "Because -- because 'tis just not done, that's why!" </p><p> The priest eyed Hamish with suspicion. Fiona's massive guard stood silently behind her as he'd done since she was a child. A large sword hung at his side, three primed pistols were stuck into his wide leather belt, his bushy red beard bristled, and his fierce gaze pinned them all in place. </p><p> "How did the lad come to be unconscious and muddy?" Father MacCanney asked pointedly. </p><p> Fiona hated to lie. She really did. But the less the priest knew, the safer he'd be from retribution from her brothers. Torn in pain at the loss of their youngest brother, they raged through Castle MacLean, fists lifted to the sky, fury pouring from them. </p><p> The curse of the MacLeans had flowed then. Rain and thunder had flooded from the skies for days, threatening those who lived in the village below Castle MacLean. The river had already been swollen from early spring rains, and the danger of flooding was imminent. </p><p> Fiona could not let that happen. And she knew how to stop the feud. First, she'd had to find Jack Kincaid. Thank goodness Hamish had heard rumors of his dalliance with some woman in nearby Stirling; it was simple to find the wastrel then. </p><p> She could only hope that the rest of her plan would follow so easily. Somehow, she greatly doubted she'd be so blessed. She shrugged and said with as much cheerful indifference as she could muster, "We found him." </p><p> "Unconscious?" </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "Where?" </p><p> "In the road. His horse must have bolted." </p><p> The priest did not look convinced. "How did the lad get so wet?" He eyed her with deep suspicion. "There's not been any rain in this part of Scotland in over three weeks." </p><p> Fiona had to distract him. "Hamish, can you awaken the lout? Father MacCanney will not marry us unless he's conscious." </p><p> Hamish grunted, then bent over, grabbed the unconscious Jack Kincaid by the hair, and lifted his head. </p><p> Fiona's gaze fell on his face, and her heart leapt. Even splashed with mud, his dark red hair plastered flat from the rain, Jack Kincaid was painfully handsome. Fine, firmly cut features with a strong jaw and masculine nose, deep auburn hair, and, had they been open, the blue, blue eyes of an angel. </p><p> But angel he was not. </p><p> In the distance, a faint rumble of thunder caused the priest to look toward the open windows. Outside, bright sunshine warmed the stone walls, nary a cloud in the blue sky. </p><p> Fiona's gaze remained on Kincaid. It took all of her moral strength not to kick him -- just a little -- while he was so conveniently at her feet. </p><p> Since that dark day fifteen years ago when she'd discovered Jack Kincaid's true nature, she'd kept her emotions and thoughts about him locked away. She'd thought they'd died, but apparently some anger and resentment remained. </p><p> Still grasping Jack's hair, Hamish shook his head, then looked at Fiona. "The jackass is not awakening." </p><p> "I can see that." Fiona sighed. "Let him be." </p><p> Hamish dropped his burden, ignoring the thud that made the priest wince. </p><p> Relief filled Father MacCanney's face. "Ye can't marry him, then." </p><p> "Yes, I can," Fiona said firmly. "He will awaken soon." </p><p> The priest sighed. "Ye are the most stubborn lass I ever met." </p><p> "Only when I must be. You cannot deny that 'twill be good for the lout to be in the care of a strong woman." </p><p> "No," Father MacCanney said in a constricted voice. "I canna deny that." </p><p> "I'll put up with neither drinking nor carousing. He will also be made to attend church regularly. Whether he knows it or not, Jack's wild days are over." </p><p> Something like pity flickered over the priest's face. "You canna make a person change, lassie. They have to <i>want</i> to change." </p><p> "Then I shall <i>make</i> him want to change." </p><p> The priest took her gloved hand in his. "Why do you wish to embark on this madness, lassie?" </p><p> "'Tis the only way to stop the feud. Callum's death must be the last," she said in a hard voice. </p><p> The priest's eyes had filled with tears. "I mourn your brother, too, lass." </p><p> "You cannot mourn Callum more than I. And as if his death is not enough to bear, my older brothers are calling out for vengeance. If someone does not stop this nonsense now -- " Her voice broke. </p><p> Callum, beautiful Callum. Her youngest brother, with his quicksilver grin and equally fast flashes of temper, was now lying six feet under, a stone marker the only reminder of his life. And all because of an idiotic feud that began hundreds of years ago. </p><p> The MacLeans and the Kincaids had been fighting for so long that no one remembered the true cause of their hatred. Now, because of Callum's stupid refusal to let a silly insult from a Kincaid slide, things had come to a head. Callum had pushed the argument, pushed the fight. And paid the price with his life. </p><p> One blow, the edge of the stone hearth...and that was it. Callum was dead, and the banked fires of the age-old feud had erupted into flames. </p><p> The priest pressed her hand. "I've heard that the Kincaids feel Callum's death was not their fault. That perhaps someone else -- " </p><p> "Please, Father. Do not." </p><p> The priest looked at her face. She knew what he was seeing: the circles under her eyes, the paleness of her skin, the tremor of her lips as she fought desperately to keep her tears at bay. </p><p> "Father," she said softly, "my brothers blame Eric Kincaid for Callum's death. Nothing I say can cool their thirst for vengeance. But if I marry Jack, he and his kin will be a part of our family. My brothers will be forced to let go of their plans." Her determined gaze locked with the priest's. "I will not lose another brother." Anger surged through her, raw and furious. </p><p> Outside, the ominous rumble of thunder darkened the otherwise clear day. Hamish nodded, as if agreeing with an unspoken thought. Father MacCanney, meanwhile, paled. </p><p> The priest was silent a long moment, and Fiona could see he was on the verge of agreeing. He just needed a little push. </p><p> "Besides, Father, if I make this sacrifice and marry to end the feud, it might break the curse." </p><p> Father MacCanney swallowed noisily and pulled his hand from her grasp. "Hsst, lass! I'll have none of that curse talk in this holy place." </p><p> That was because he believed it. According to the old tales, a white witch, disgusted with Fiona's great-grandfather's temper and self-serving ways, had declared that from then on, every member of the MacLean family would be given tenuous control over something as tempestuous as they were -- the weather. </p><p> Whenever a MacLean lost his or her temper, lightning caused thatched houses to catch afire and made the ground tremble. Hail tore away the leaves of every tree and greenery within sight. Floods roared through the valley, ruining harvests, washing away homes and, sometimes, people. </p><p> When the people of the village saw clouds gathering at Castle MacLean on the hill, they huddled in their houses in fear. </p><p> Fiona closed her eyes. They were her people. <i>Hers.</i> Just as Callum had been her brother. She could not fail in this. If she did not defuse the situation, her brothers' fury would unthinkingly destroy everything. </p><p> The only way to break the curse was for every member of a generation to perform a "deed of great good." So far, no generation had succeeded. Perhaps this would count as Fiona's deed. </p><p> Fiona looked at the priest from beneath her lashes. "The curse has been proven time and again, Father." </p><p> The priest shoo...</p></p><h2>They Came to the Mountain The Story of Flagstaff&#39;s Beginnings</h2><p>This book is the first history of Flagstaff&#39;s formative years but is more than a local account.

It examines the people and events surrounding this amphibious invasion, and includes contributions from both participants and military historians.</p><p><i>The Simon and Schuster Encyclopedia of World War II</i> (1978) has long been considered a standard source because of its comprehensive, objective treatment of battles, strategies, officers, statesmen, weapons, treaties, etc. Now, in time to commemorate the upcoming fiftieth anniversary of D-Day on June 6th, comes an entirely new work on Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of northwest Europe.<p>The more than 400 signed entries in <i>The D-Day Encyclopedia</i> cover in considerable detail the period June 6-18, the latter being the date on which the beachhead was secured. Most of the 141 contributors--academicians and military professionals--are from Great Britain and the U.S., but a number are from Germany and other European countries and Canada. The coeditors, Chandler and Collins, are, respectively, a historian at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, and a retired U.S. Army officer who landed at Utah Beach and now serves as a military historian. The nine-member editorial board includes an equal number of British, German, and American scholars.</p><p>The core of the encyclopedia consists of approximately 40 articles on Allied and German army divisions and brigades and on the higher organizational units to which they belonged. Similar attention is given to naval and air force units. Articles of varying length cover 11 Allied countries and German- and Allied-flag ships.</p><p>The 175 biographies are for heads of state (Roosevelt, Mackenzie King, etc.) and Allied and German officers of one-star rank or higher who commanded a division or its equivalent. While half of these individuals are also in the <i>Simon and Schuster Encyclopedia</i>, the sketches in <i>The D-Day Encyclopedia</i> more precisely state their D-Day contributions. For example, the Patton entry in the 1978 encyclopedia does not mention his D-Day whereabouts. All entries conclude with bibliographies of sources in English, German. and French. In addition, there are the informative articles <i>Archival Sources</i> (with separate discussions of Allied and German archives) and <i>Bibliography</i> (limited to literature in English).</p><p>More than 350 black-and-white photographs of individuals, aircraft, ships, weapons, and field equipment accompany articles. Maps depict such information as American-held beaches at midnight on June 6th, British Commonwealth war cemeteries, and the U.S. Army VII Corps beachhead at the end of D-Day. The text is also enhanced with charts, graphs, and statistics (e.g., an organizational chart of the Seventh Army, casualties of the 82d Airborne Division during the Normandy campaign).</p><p>The volume concludes with a synoptic table of contents that lists entries under such headings as <i>Army Topics</i>, <i>Navy Topics</i>, and <i>Biographies</i>; a list of German military units and their English-language equivalents (e.g., <i>Luftwaffe</i>--German Air Force); a table of comparative ranks; and a glossary. Three appendixes reprint Eisenhower's order of the day for June 6th, a top-secret directive from Hitler, and a digest of the plan for Operation Overlord. A detailed index has numerous <i>see</i> and <i>see also</i> references.</p><p>This work is a perceptive, authoritative, and substantive contribution for scholars, students, and general readers seeking a perspective on what has been called "the single most complex and significant amphibious operation in all history." A recommended purchase for public and academic libraries. <i></i></p>A hefty one-volume encyclopedia covering the D-Day invasion of Normandy by the Allies in 1944, and issue on its 50th anniversary, this work presents the facts around that monumental event with alphabetized entries, accompanied by maps, charts, and black-and-white photos. It is strictly a reference work, the writing, by a host of experts well known in the academic and military fields, and edited by Chandler of the Royal Military Academy in England, provides the facts in a thorough but undramatic fashion. The many subjects that this vast work encompasses include logistics, materiel, intelligence and counterintelligence, and personnel movements. The selection of photos of the personalities, places, and hardware is adequate, but for the cost of the volume, the contrast in the photographs is occasionally too poor to make them of much use. Every entry has its own bibliography. There exists no comparable reference work. Meant for academic collections, it draws together the most complete collection of data on this event and its associated military actions to make an exhaustive resource.

Lin Townsend, raised by a religious zealot, had a rough childhood and got pregnant when she was 17. Thrown out of her home, she raises her son, Will, poor and alone, and the letters she sends over the years to Nick Pemberton, Will's father, are returned to sender. Lin eventually saves enough to send Will to NYU, but just before his freshman year, Lin runs into Nick, who is now married, wealthy, and has no clue who Lin is. And so Lin vows revenge: her plot is to tie up Nick's money and to make him suffer like she did for all those years. Meanwhile, Nick discovers he has leukemia and decides to cut off his bitch of a wife, who has her own dastardly plans. None of it is especially believable, and the characters are either underdeveloped or maddeningly inconsistent. Additionally, Michaels's prose is frequently slapdash (It wasn't possible, yet her common sense told her it was highly probable!), but that's unlikely to diminish the book's commercial prospects. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fewer and fewer families adopting today are able to bring home a healthy newborn infant. The majority of adoptions now involve emotionally wounded, older children who have suffered the effects of abuse or neglect in their birth families and carry complex baggage with them into their adoptive families. Adopting the Hurt Child addresses the frustrations, heartache, and hope surrounding the adoptions of these special-needs kids. Children who have endured emotional and physical atrocities, failed reunifications, and myriad losses associated with multiple moves in the foster care system not only present unique challenges to their adoptive families but also impact greater society in significant ways. Integrating social, psychological, and sociopolitical issues, Adopting the Hurt Child explains how trauma and interruptions affect these children&#x2019;s normal development and often severely undermine their capacity to function in a loving family and in society. Written in a non-technical style accessible to a diverse audience, Adopting the Hurt Child brings to light grim truths, but also real hope that children who have been hurt can be healed and brought back into life by the adoptive and foster parents, therapists, teachers, social workers, and others whose lives interact with theirs.Gregory C.

Approaching commercial messages as unacknowledged art forms and cultural artifacts, McLuhan delivers a series of probes that pick apart their meanings and underlying values, their paradoxes and paralogisms, and their overt function as persuasion and propaganda. Through humor, satire, and a poetic sensibility, he provides us with a serious exploration of the consumer culture that emerged out of the electronic media environment. In keeping with the participatory ethos of the Internet that McLuhan so clearly anticipated, this is a book that is meant to open the door to further study, reflection, and discussion, and to encourage the development of critical reception on the part of the reader.</p><p>Marshall McLuhan (1911-1980) was a pioneer Canadian theorist and educator in the fields of communication and media studies. He taught at the University of Toronto from 1946 to 1979 and became popular for his aphorism, &#34;the medium is the message&#34; which summarized his view of the media&#39;s potent influence on shaping culture and styles of thinking. His major writings include The Gutenberg Galaxy (1962), Understanding Media (1964), and The Medium Is the Massage (1967).''Culture Is Our Business represents an essential component of McLuhan's body of work and provides an important contribution to media ecology, cultural studies, and media literacy. As with most of McLuhan's scholarship, its value and relevance has only increased since its initial publication.''<br>--Lance Strate, Professor of Communication and Media Studies, Fordham University, and author of Echoes and Reflections, On the Binding Biases of Time, and Amazing Ourselves to Death<br><br>''Here is an interactive playground � la McLuhan that takes you on a hilarious and revealing journey across Western, or better, 'American Civilization.' Reading this book is rediscovering the brave new world of (electric) advertising in its prime; most incisively, it suggests a tactic to escape the enchanting songs of corporate art to fully see the Emperor's new clothes.''<br>--Elena Lamberti, Professor of North American Studies, University of Bologna, and author of Marshall McLuhan's Mosaic --Wipf and Stock Publishers</p><h2>Mars #4</h2><p>When Rei&#39;s old girlfriend, Shiori, turns up and declares that she still loves him and cannot live without him, Kira finds her relationship with Rei tested by Shiora&#39;s obsession and by Rei&#39;s guilt over his brother&#39;s death.</p><p></p><h2>Minimum</h2><p>Architect John Pawson delves into all aspects of minimalism inthis compact (five-by-five-inch) but thick (325-page) format. ReadingMinimum is almost like sitting in a slide lecture given by apassionate professor of pared-down design. It is a picture bookprimarily, and Pawson&#39;s choice of images is personal and quirky. Hischapter headings refer to many sources and aspects of design: Mass,Light, Structure, Ritual, Landscape, Order, Containment, Repetition,Volume, Essence, and Expression. The pictures in each section range fromsculptures and paintings to landscapes to ritual objects to rooms tocolonnades and piazzas, cityscapes and private homes. Pawson&#39;sselections are evocative, but not always effective. One caption reads,&#34;The intense luminescence of Mark Rothko&#39;s painting,&#34; but the pictureshown is one of Rothko&#39;s late, dark, depressed canvasses, which atthree-by-five-inches seems more a smudge than a glow. Images dominatethis book, but Pawson has also written an ardent introductory essay thatplaces his selections in context. &#34;What I look for is the excitement ofempty space,&#34; he writes. &#34;It has the capacity to bring architecturealive, just as it does a Chinese scroll painting. Emptiness allows us tosee space as it is, to see architecture as it is, preventing it frombeing corrupted, or hidden, by the incidental debris of theparaphernalia of everyday life. It offers the space, both psychologicaland physical, for contemplation, and the serenity that can encouragemeditative quiet and calm, without the jarring distraction ofpossessions.&#34; --Peggy Moorman</p><p>John Pawson is a renowned architect and designer specializing in the Minimalist aesthetic. He has designed interiors for Calvin Klein, B&amp;B Italia and the Cathay Pacific Lounge at the Hong Kong International Airport. His own work is the subject of two books John Pawson Works and John Pawson Themes and Projects, both published by Phaidon.&#39;Thought-provoking book on minimalism.&#39; (The World of Interiors) &#39;His critically acclaimed Minimum book, had been redesigned as a portable edition.

This appropriately pared down version of John Pawson&#39;s acclaimed 1996 study of minimalism takes readers on a beautifully presented journey round the notion of simplicity - in architecture, art and design.&#39; (Exposure) &#39;If you can&#39;t get to Hong Kong, but want an insight into the rich variety of sources that have influenced Pawson&#39;s architecture, try his book Minimum, newly re-issued in a miniature hardback version.&#39; (Conde Nast Traveller) &#39;Immaculately produced by Phaidon, [Minimum] is a small slab of a book (140mm x 160mm square) and a tactile delight on every level. Exactly the sort of style icon that will sit demurely on a coffee table or with ostentatious cool in the chaos of a briefcase.&#39; (The Right Angle) &#39;There is something very covetable about this new, compact, chunky version of the 1996 bestseller. Truly pared down - its price has shrunk too ( the original cost GBP60) - Pawson&#39;s &#39;visual essay&#39; is a selection of images that are sometimes beautifully simple, but also pretentious.&#39; (British Journal of Photography) &#39;John Pawson&#39;s seminal book Minimum achieved world-wide recognition for provoking interest and exploration into the notion of minimalism. Two years since its original publication this unique guide to simplicity is reprinted in a desirable mini format. This neat, portable book is a visual essay expressing and embodying the ideas of austerity, reduction, and simplicity ... The original edition received unprecedented attention and soon sold out. To reprint the book in the usual paperback format did not seem justifiable and with a constant dedication to design, Phaidon decided that the beauty and and quality of the original edition could only be retained in a stylish miniature format ... The end result is this small object of desire and simplicity.&#39; (Perspective) &#39;An elegant and restrained reference work.&#39; (Frame) &#39;In itself a wonderful object, Minimum is already a collector&#39;s item.&#39; (Observer) &#39;A searching discourse on the appeal of minimalism, an exploration of the author&#39;s thoughts on architecture, art and life, accompanied by extraordinary photographs to show the power of minimalism.

When he later discovered "Song to Woody," Dylan&#x2019;s tribute to his hero, Woody Guthrie, Wolff believed he&#x2019;d uncovered one source of Dylan&#x2019;s rage. Sifting through Guthrie&#x2019;s recordings, Wolff found "1913 Massacre"&#x2014;a song which told the story of a union Christmas party during a strike in Calumet, Michigan, in 1913 that ended in horrific tragedy. </p><p>Following the trail from Dylan to Guthrie to an event that claimed the lives of seventy-four men, women, and children a century ago, Wolff found himself tracing the history of an anger that has been passed down for decades. From America&#x2019;s early industrialized days, an epic battle to determine the country&#x2019;s direction has been waged, pitting bosses against workers and big business against the labor movement. In Guthrie&#x2019;s eyes, the owners ultimately won; the 1913 Michigan tragedy was just one example of a larger lost history purposely distorted and buried in time. </p><p>In this magnificent cultural study, Wolff braids three disparate strands&#x2014;Calumet, Guthrie, and Dylan&#x2014;together to create a devastating revisionist history of twentieth-century America. <em>Grown-Up Anger</em> chronicles the struggles between the haves and have-nots, the impact changing labor relations had on industrial America, and the way two musicians used their fury to illuminate economic injustice and inspire change.</p></p><p><p>In this tour de force of storytelling, Daniel Wolff braids together three disparate strands&#x2014;Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, and a labor strike in northern Michigan&#x2014;to create a devastating revisionist history of twentieth-century America. </p><p>At thirteen, when he first heard Dylan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Like a Rolling Stone,&#x201d; Wolff recognized the sound of grown-up anger.

She had lived there since kindergarten. Tomato slugs lived at the bottom of the front steps. A plum tree lived in the backyard. The kitchen smelled like <i>jook</i> and ice cream.<br><br>Ruby liked the rain. It rained often on 20th Avenue South. The rain sprinkled diamonds on spiderwebs and poured silver on the sidewalks. At night the rain was a lullaby of a billion grains of rice falling on the roof.<br><br>Ruby liked the sunshine. It was not often sunny on 20th Avenue South, but when it was, all the bottle caps in the street shone like coins. Windows opened. Radios played. Laundry dried. Plums ripened. Mothers took their babies out.<br><br>Ruby liked the bus. The No. 3 ran from Chinatown to the Jefferson Golf Course. Ruby's pohpoh and gunggung lived in Chinatown. Ruby lived near the Jefferson Golf Course. The No. 3 bus brought PohPoh to Ruby, or Ruby to PohPoh, whenever GungGung was too busy to drive them, and they saw each other as often as they could.<br><br>Ruby liked her school. Kimball Elementary was usually four blocks away. But whenever Ruby got the urge, school was nine blocks away: two more blocks over to the driving range to look for golf balls that had come through the fence, three blocks backtracking to school. Ruby was almost eight and was <i>finally</i> allowed to walk to school by herself. She wore lots of reflective tape -- just so her mother wouldn't have to worry, especially on foggy mornings.<br><br>"Everyone should wear reflective tape," Ruby liked to say. And she got to say this every year at the school safety assembly.<br><br>Ruby liked her new wallet. The librarian gave out a shiny wallet to every child who became a card-carrying member of the Beacon Hill Public Library. It was school-bus yellow and closed with crunchy Velcro. Ruby carried her wallet everywhere. It meant that she was almost ready for a driver's license and credit cards. Ruby could hardly wait.<br><br>Ruby especially liked after school. Mr. Tupahotu's magic class began at 3:12 sharp. Ruby was never late. Mr. Tupahotu had been a famous magician before he became a teacher. He turned scarves into butterflies. He floated a beautiful lady in midair. He owned 513 rabbits (not all at once). He appeared on TV. He signed an autograph for Ruby.<br><br>The Great Tupahotu was now just a regular guy, but he was not your regular second-grade teacher. He could read a whole Russian novel (without falling asleep) and usually one of Ruby's book reports (without confusing the two). In addition he could tell who threw the paper airplane just by the way it was <br><br>folded, and fold a much more impressive one. He knew the difference between a person, place, and thing, except sometimes when it came to Ruby's imaginative writing. And he could write in cursive, even on the blackboard.<br><br>In magic class he made everything look so easy. But everything was actually very hard. Ruby could never do any of the tricks the first time around. Or the second. Or sometimes even the 199th. But she was getting better.<br><br>She could put a coin through her elbow.<br><br>She could cut a string into two pieces and then turn it back into one piece.<br><br>She could hypnotize a handkerchief and make it obey.<br><br>She could almost make a coin stand up just by blowing on it.<br><br>She could make knots disappear...usually.<br><br>And she could make flowers appear...sometimes.<br><br>Ruby starred in her very own backyard magic show, Ruby's Magic Madness. And neighbors on 20th Avenue South agreed that she was truly amazing.<br><br>Ruby liked her neighbors. Wally lived across the street. Before that he'd lived in Hong Kong. Wally was the only child Ruby knew who could speak Cantonese without having gone to Chinese school. He was fluent, Ruby's mother said, which meant that he could speak Chinese all day without running out of words. Ruby was very impressed. Still, she was glad when Wally did not sign up for magic class. With a little help from Ruby, he had signed up for Bonsai Club.<br><br>Tiger was Ruby's best friend. He lived two blocks away, but it felt like he lived next door. He was faster than e-mail. "Don't break the speed limit!" his mother always called after him. He was also fast at making friends. With just the right smile, he was always saying hi and having a chat. Ruby didn't make friends so quickly. She liked her old friends best.<br><br>"You never know when a new friend might become <i>another</i> best friend," Tiger told Ruby. "Just smile and look them smack in the eye."<br><br>But the very best thing about living on 20th Avenue South was Oscar. Oscar was Ruby's baby brother. When he was brand-new, he felt as solid as wrapped tuna from the Pike Place Market and smelled like fresh-baked <i>daan taht</i>. He was more beautiful than Ruby had imagined. She had waited a very long time for him. And when he came home from the hospital, she had nearly forgotten that she had wished for a puppy.<br><br>The second very best thing about living on 20th Avenue South was Emma. Emma had the cutest, sweetest little dog. He had a mouthful of pointy teeth and little feet with toenails that went <i>dop-dop-dop</i> wherever he went. His name was Elwyn and he was bilingual. He obeyed commands in Cantonese (thanks to Wally) and in English. He'd graduated summa cum laude from dog obedience school, and so had Emma. Emma was very proud of Elwyn. And Elwyn was happy to be the only dog on 20th Avenue South.<br><br>But Emma also had a baby brother. When he was brand-new, he, too, felt like wrapped fish and smelled like something freshly baked. Sam was more beautiful than Emma had imagined. She had waited a very long time for him. And when he arrived, she and Ruby became as close as sisters.<br><br>Sam weighed 8 pounds, 10 ounces, at birth.<br><br>So did Oscar.<br><br>Sam scored a 9.5 out of a perfect 10 on his Apgar test.<br><br>So did Oscar.<br><br>Sam could tell when it was lunchtime.<br><br>So could Oscar.<br><br>When Sam was only two days old, he smiled at Emma.<br><br>"It's just gas," Ruby had explained. "It says here that if babies smile before four weeks old, it's only because of gas."<br><br>That's what the baby book said. But Emma didn't believe it. Emma smiled at Sam. And Sam smiled back. Ruby saw it with her very own eyes. She'd had to think fast.<br><br>She climbed their plum tree, but Oscar wasn't watching.<br><br>Time out.<br><br>So she climbed back down.<br><br>She took a bathroom break.<br><br>When she came back, she tried some jokes.<br><br>A feather.<br><br>Funny faces.<br><br>f0 <br><br>But all Oscar did was cry and sleep.<br><br>Ruby wanted to cry too. Waiting for a stinky baby brother to smile was harder than waiting for morning recess at school.<br><br>Finally, Oscar smiled at Ruby, and he was still only two days old.<br><br>Before long Sam rolled over.<br><br>So did Oscar.<br><br>Sam sat up.<br><br>So did Oscar.<br><br>Sam cut his first tooth.<br><br>So did Oscar.<br><br>Sam said his first word.<br><br>"Da," he said.<br><br>Emma beamed.<br><br>"Da da da," he said. In case nobody heard, he said it louder, <i>"Da da da!"</i><br><br>Ruby looked at Oscar.<br><br>Oscar looked at Ruby.<br><br>Oscar really was the cutest little brother on 20th Avenue South. He had headlight eyes, a drippy tongue, and a runny little nose. Ruby liked doing her magic tricks for Oscar, who cooed and drooled and clapped under their plum tree. Ruby's magic show had many fans, but Oscar was the best one of all. When everyone else went home, Oscar was still there. Oscar loved Ruby. And Ruby loved Oscar.<br><br>But Oscar was not <i>producing</i>, as Emma had delicately put it.<br><br>"Please," Ruby pleaded. "Say something....Anything."<br><br>Oscar put all his toes in his mouth.<br><br>He blew bubbles through his lips.<br><br>He laughed.<br><br>To make matters worse, Sam said his second word. And then his third. And his fourth. Soon, he said what sounded like the longest sentence Ruby had ever heard.<br><br>"Da dee a ma mi haba bee dee bee bee," he said.<br><br>"Daddy and Mommy have a pretty baby," Emma translated triumphantly.<br><br>So Ruby tried candy.<br><br>And presents.<br><br>She promised fireworks.<br><br>She tried hypnosis.<br><br>Desperate, she asked for advice.<br><br>"Sorry," said the lady at the dog obedience school, giving Oscar the once-over in his puppy suit. "He has to be a <i>real</i> puppy."<br><br>"Every baby develops at his own rate," <br><br>Mr. Tupahotu gently told Ruby. "You can't hurry nature."<br><br>So Ruby tried the library. She borrowed language tapes and videos.<br><br>She put Oscar in front of the mirror. She moved his lips. He moved his hips. Ruby was a convincing ventriloquist. And Oscar was ready for his nap.<br><br>Ruby was close to tears. Oscar gave Ruby a yawn. And a burp. <br><br>But Oscar did not say boo.<br><br>That night Ruby dreamed that Oscar was making a speech.<br><br>"My fellow babies...," Oscar began.<br><br>Millions were transfixed. When Oscar finished, the applause was thunderous and utterly transporting. Ruby clapped loudest of all.<br><br>The next morning Ruby ran straight to Oscar's room. But Oscar the Orator was nowhere to be seen. It was just the same old Oscar. And Ruby felt her love for him getting thin around the edges.<br><br>Now the worst thing about living on 20th Avenue South was Oscar. Oscar was not talking. If only Oscar would say something -- <i>one</i> word -- everything would be right again. Rain would fall. Slugs would ooze. Plums would grow. It was all Ruby wanted. It was all she could think of. She wished for it with her cigar box full of old birthday candles and Thanksgiving wishbones. And just before falling asleep, she wished for it upon all the stars in the sky.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Lenore Look</p><h2>Otto Goes to Bed</h2><p>Meet Otto! &#34;Woof, woof!&#34; It&#39;s time for bed, but Otto doesn&#39;t want to go.

She lives in rural Ontario, Canada.<p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>I woke to my ex-fianc� calling. Which was awkward, considering we&#x2019;d broken up only two months ago and I was in another guy&#x2019;s apartment. Even more awkward when that guy wasn&#x2019;t the one I was currently dating. In my defense, I was on the couch.</p><p>My first thought was not <i>Answer the damned phone, Olivia</i>. It was of a letter from my father, read right before I went to sleep, which had not been conducive to good dreams and had left me in no mood to talk to James Morgan. I reached for my phone and hit Ignore. A moment later, a shadow loomed over me.</p><p>Gabriel picked up my phone. &#x201c;James. He left a message. I should take it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Um, my cell? My ex?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your stalker, too.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked up. Gabriel is at least six-four and knows how to use his size to his advantage. Hence the looming.</p><p>When I nodded, he listened to the message as I tried very hard to push aside thoughts of James and the roller-coaster ride that began when I found out my real parents were convicted serial killers. The ride had ultimately landed me here, sleeping in the apartment of one of Chicago&#x2019;s most notorious defense attorneys. My lawyer. My boss. And, though I&#x2019;d never dare say it in front of him, my friend.</p><p>Gabriel Walsh doesn&#x2019;t have friends. He has resources: people who can be exploited and used. I&#x2019;d like to think I&#x2019;m an exception, but I don&#x2019;t push my luck.</p><p>&#x201c;James heard about last night,&#x201d; Gabriel said after listening to the message.</p><p>&#x201c;The car crash?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but I believe he&#x2019;s more concerned about the crazed killer who caused the crash and held you at gunpoint.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A minor point, but it seems to bother him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unreasonably so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Agreed. Coffee?&#x201d;</p><p>I rose and started for the kitchen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make it. You were in that accident, too, and hurt a lot worse than me. You should be resting.&#x201d;</p><p>He moved into my path and waved me back. That wasn&#x2019;t him playing congenial host; it was him telling me to stay the hell out of his kitchen. I suspected last night was the first time he&#x2019;d brought anyone up here. His apartment. His private domain.</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;d rather I didn&#x2019;t stay&#x2014;&#x201d; I began.</p><p>&#x201c;I invited you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;After sustaining a head injury. Which means you aren&#x2019;t responsible for anything you said last night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. except for the part where you forgave me for wrecking your car.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were run off the road.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I still feel bad. It was a nice car.&#x201d; I paused. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m also sorry about almost getting you killed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She says, as an afterthought.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was a really nice car.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head and went into the kitchen. I followed as far as the doorway.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need to let James know you&#x2019;re all right,&#x201d; Gabriel said. &#x201c;I would suggest a text message. Tell him&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can write my own texts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but this must be handled with care. While I&#x2019;d prefer you didn&#x2019;t engage him at all, if you don&#x2019;t tell him you&#x2019;re fine, he has an excuse to keep hounding you. Yet if you give any indication you&#x2019;re opening the door to conversation, he has <i>reason</i> to keep hounding you.&#x201d;</p><p>I had to agree. Gabriel dictated a message. I did tweak his wording&#x2014;Gabriel&#x2019;s language choices can be very precise, and James couldn&#x2019;t suspect the text had come from him. He seemed to think Gabriel had a Svengali sway over me. Which showed that my former fianc� didn&#x2019;t know me nearly as well as I&#x2019;d thought he did.</p><p>Message sent, we settled in with our coffee, chairs pulled to the living room window, where we could look out over Gabriel&#x2019;s breathtaking view of the city.</p><p>&#x201c;I had a call this morning,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Edgar Chandler wishes to speak to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Chandler?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Elderly gentleman. Currently incarcerated. Formerly involved in CIA experiments. Seems to have unlocked the secret of mind control. Which he used in an attempt to kill us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know who Chandler is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It seemed as if a refresher might be required, given the sheer number of people who have tried to kill us lately.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True. So he&#x2019;ll finally speak to us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Chandler has no interest in me. The invitation is for you. May I presume you&#x2019;ll accept?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;May I presume you&#x2019;ll come with me?&#x201d;</p><p>His brows shot up. &#x201c;Of course. Whether he wants me there or not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>Gabriel arranged to see Chandler that afternoon. A half hour later we were in the elevator, taking the fifty-five-story ride down to the underground parking garage.</p><p>&#x201c;So what else are we doing today?&#x201d; I asked as we exited the elevator. &#x201c;The only thing on my schedule is working at the diner. Which I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d; I wasn&#x2019;t sure if I ever could again. I&#x2019;d told Larry I was unwell&#x2014;between the accident and the fever that preceded it&#x2014;and needed some time off, and he&#x2019;d given me two weeks.</p><p>&#x201c;I require a vehicle,&#x201d; Gabriel said. &#x201c;Since that is your area of expertise, I&#x2019;m taking you along to select one. After that, we&#x2019;ll pick up a rental car. Then we&#x2019;ll drop your car back here and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Skip the play-by-play and hit the highlights, please.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Today will be devoted primarily to cleaning up the mess from yesterday. We need&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>An almost imperceptible tightening of his shoulders told me something had caught his attention. Gabriel has an uncanny sense for trouble, which may be because his gene pool, like mine, contains a sprinkling of fairy dust.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; I whispered.</p><p>He scanned the row of parked cars. &#x201c;Do you have your gun?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Always.&#x201d;</p><p>He put his fingers against my back and propelled me forward.</p><p>&#x201c;Any warnings?&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>&#x201c;Portents of impending doom?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Not a one, but honestly? I&#x2019;m discombobulated enough this morning that I could trip over five dead birds and not notice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re both out of sorts. Which reminds me that I need to stop by the doctor and pick up a prescription for pain&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>When he wheeled, I didn&#x2019;t jump. Nor was I surprised to see a man two paces behind us. Gabriel admitting he needed pain meds had conveyed a warning as clearly as if he&#x2019;d shouted it.</p><p>The man didn&#x2019;t look like the sort who&#x2019;d be stalking us in an empty parking garage: early forties, decent suit, gray-salted beard. A reporter? I&#x2019;d had to deal with plenty lately.</p><p>&#x201c;May I help you?&#x201d; Gabriel rumbled, his deep voice dropping another octave.</p><p>&#x201c;Gabriel Walsh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>The man held out a thick envelope. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been served. This is&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Gabriel grabbed the guy by the wrist, wrenching his arm up. The guy yelped, but didn&#x2019;t drop the envelope&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or the semi-automatic pistol he&#x2019;d tried to conceal in his other hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Give Mr. Walsh your gun,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>The man stared in confusion at the gun in my own hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Give it to him now.&#x201d;</p><p>He opened his fingers and dropped his pistol. Gabriel grabbed for it with his free hand. Then he stopped sharply. &#x201c;Oliv&#x2014;!&#x201d;</p><p>The gun clattered to the pavement. And cold steel pressed into the back of my neck.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to do that,&#x201d; Gabriel said, his pale blue eyes fixed on my captor.</p><p>A man&#x2019;s chuckle sounded behind me. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;re in any position to make that demand, Mr. Walsh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you are mistaken. Hurt her, and you will regret it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Regret it? That&#x2019;s all? I expected &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll hunt you down and kill you&#x2019; at the very least.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Death is quick. Regret is not.&#x201d;</p><p>The gun pressed harder into my neck, as if the man was leaning forward. &#x201c;Clever, Mr. Walsh. I&#x2019;m sure Ms. Jones is very impressed. Her knight in tarnished armor. Impressionable young women must find that very hard to resist.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They may,&#x201d; Gabriel said. &#x201c;Unfortunately, we don&#x2019;t have any here at the moment, so you&#x2019;ll have to trust the threat is for your benefit alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Chivalry <i>and</i> flattery. Are your knees weak yet, Ms. Jones? Oh, and do put away the gun. Please.&#x201d;</p><p>I hesitated, then lowered it into my bag.</p><p>&#x201c;Now remove your hand <i>from</i> your purse, Ms. Jones.&#x201d;</p><p>I did.</p><p>The man continued, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to believe modern young women wouldn&#x2019;t fall for Mr. Walsh&#x2019;s act, but the very fact you are with him proves otherwise. We&#x2019;ll have to chat about that later. For now, you&#x2019;ll come with me, Ms. Jones, while Mr. Walsh releases my confederate and then stays where he is until we are out of sight. If he follows, you will pay the price. Understood, Mr. Walsh?&#x201d;</p><p>My assailant dug the gun barrel in hard enough to make me wince. Gabriel punted the other man&#x2019;s gun under the cars and then released him with a shove. My assailant took hold of my arm. When he lowered the gun, I stabbed him in the side, having palmed the switchblade from my purse. He fell back, and I grabbed for his gun arm. I missed. Gabriel didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>Gabriel wrenched the man&#x2019;s arm up. His partner crawled after his lost weapon, but when I told him to stop, he saw the gun back in my hand and decided to listen.</p><p>Gabriel threw my attacker to the ground. It was another guy in a suit. Bald. Thirties. He immediately started rising, one hand clutched to the knife wound. Gabriel calmly punched him in the side of the head. The guy dropped, unconscious, to the pavement.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s blood on your shirt,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Gabriel glanced down and sighed.</p><p>&#x201c;You can put it on my bill,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He shook his head and walked over to the first man, who had started inching toward his gun again. I&#x2019;d noticed, but at the rate he was moving, he&#x2019;d be lucky to make it there by lunch. Gabriel grabbed the guy from under the car, flipped him on his back, and put one Ferragamo loafer on his chest.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve decided to speak to you instead of your partner,&#x201d; Gabriel said. &#x201c;Tell me now if I&#x2019;ve made the wrong choice.&#x201d;</p><p>The man wriggled, as if testing how tightly he was pinned. When Gabriel leaned forward, he gasped and lay still.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll presume that means I did not,&#x201d; Gabriel said. &#x201c;Prove me wrong, and I&#x2019;ll break every rib in your chest. Is that understood?&#x201d;</p><p>The guy looked offended. Coming after us with guns was fine, but God forbid we should fight back.</p><p>&#x201c;Olivia, could you please keep an eye on the elevator and the entrance lane? It&#x2019;s after rush hour so we&#x2019;re unlikely to be interrupted, but it would be inconvenient.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;</p><p>I moved past the unconscious man and the growing pool of blood at his side. I wondered if I should do something about that, but he seemed to be breathing comfortably.</p><p>I took up position about fifteen feet from Gabriel, where I could see anyone driving into the garage or coming off the elevator.</p><p>&#x201c;Who hired you?&#x201d; he asked our captive.</p><p>No answer. Then a gasp, as Gabriel presumably applied pressure&#x2014;literally.</p><p>&#x201c;We were hired to speak to Ms. Jones,&#x201d; the man said after Gabriel let up a little. &#x201c;By someone who is extremely concerned about her welfare. She&#x2019;s in a very precarious place right now and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;James,&#x201d; Gabriel said, the name a growl.</p><p>The man continued, &#x201c;As my associate said, it&#x2019;s obvious you&#x2019;ve positioned yourself as her protector. She&#x2019;s vulnerable and alone. You provided a shoulder to lean on and, in doing so, you&#x2019;ve influenced her perception of reality to the point where she can no longer see the truth. It&#x2019;s our job to counter that influence.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;James Morgan hired cult deprogrammers?&#x201d; It&#x2019;s hard to surprise Gabriel, but his voice rose with incredulity.</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t like to use that word. But when undue influence is exerted over the vulnerable, intervention may be required to help the victim see the situation clearly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I&#x2019;m exerting undue influence. For what purpose?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Money, obviously. That&#x2019;s what you always want, isn&#x2019;t it, Walsh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you are implying that I&#x2019;m charging Olivia for my time, her account is closed. She did hire me to help investigate the deaths of two of her parents&#x2019; alleged victims. But we completed that inquiry successfully. In fact, <i>I&#x2019;m</i> paying Olivia now, as a research assistant and investigator.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My associate said you were clever, Mr. Walsh, and he&#x2019;s correct. Yes, you&#x2019;re paying her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to deflect suspicion and to maintain an excuse for ongoing contact, while you continue to pursue the real prize.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which would be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A five-million-dollar trust fund. Which comes due when she turns twenty-five. A few months from now.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabriel grunted.</p><p>After at least five seconds of silence, the man said, &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t even going to deny it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To whom? You&#x2019;re hired help. I don&#x2019;t need to convince you of anything. The very thought that anyone&#x2014;however skilled a manipulator&#x2014;could persuade Olivia to part with her fortune is ridiculous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I offered to pay for the shirt,&#x201d; I called. &#x201c;But not the car. The car wasn&#x2019;t my fault, and it&#x2019;s insured.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; Gabriel said. &#x201c;I would also point out that, given how handily she disarmed your colleague, you might be mistaken about her vulnerability. I will forgive you for that, based on your very short acquaintance with her. James Morgan has no such excuse. Beyond the fact that he&#x2019;s an idiot.&#x201d;</p><p>The man was silent.</p><p>&#x201c;I have noticed,&#x201d; Gabriel said, &#x201c;that despite your unwillingness to name him as your client, you haven&#x2019;t denied that he is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;According to the contract, I cannot identify the man who hired us. There is no provision against acknowledging it, though. He&#x2019;s very concerned about his fianc�e&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not his fianc�e,&#x201d; I called.</p><p>&#x201c;The engagement ended two months ago,&#x201d; Gabriel said.</p><p>&#x201c;Which does not keep him from being concerned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get proof,&#x201d; I called.</p><p>&#x201c;Of his concern?&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>&#x201c;Of his involvement,&#x201d; Gabriel said. &#x201c;Prove to me that James Morgan is indeed your client and I will release you.&#x201d;</p><p>The man warned Gabriel that he was reaching for his phone. He passed it over. Gabriel read the screen and then waved me over to have a look.</p><p>It was an e-mail exchange with James. A little cloak-and-dagger in the wording, but the intent was clear. These men were to take me, by force, and persuade me that Gabriel Walsh was a very, very bad man. I forwarded it to both of us.</p><p>Gabriel took his foot off the man&#x2019;s chest. We retrieved the gun from under the car. Or, I should say, I retrieved it. Gabriel wouldn&#x2019;t fit, which I deemed a poor excuse. We left the so-called deprogrammer tending to his partner&#x2019;s wounds.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Gabriel didn&#x2019;t say a word on the walk back to the elevator, on the ride up, or even once we got through his door. I shot the bolt. At the click, he turned, as if startled, and then nodded.</p><p>He changed his shirt, walked to the window and stood there, fingers drumming against his leg. Then he came my way so fast I stepped aside. He unlocked the door and walked out.</p><p>He was in the elevator by the time I caught up. The doors were about a hand&#x2019;s breadth from shutting before he stopped them and leaned out.</p><p>&#x201c;You need to come with me,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to.&#x201d;</p><p>We returned to the parking garage. Our attackers were gone. Gabriel walked to his space and stood staring at my VW.</p><p>&#x201c;Um, yeah,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Your car was totaled, remember? That&#x2019;s why you need me. Unless you plan to take a cab.&#x201d;</p><p>He grunted. Letting someone else drive was a relinquishing of control he couldn&#x2019;t abide with anyone except me and his aunt Rose.</p><p>&#x201c;May I have your keys?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you are. I&#x2019;m not leavin...</p></p><h2>Heat</h2><p>Las Vegas security man Nick Escalante, an ex-Marine, chances on to a bizarre kidnapping threat and races into a night-time world of false identities, vicious grievances, and gruesome encounters</p><p>New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Donna Grant has been praised for her &#34;totally addictive&#34; and &#34;unique and sensual&#34; stories.

Schwartz's pieces can keep a reader mystified in almost every way who, why, what, where but never in the perfect logic of sentences moving forward one after another: what comes next, comes next, most often brilliantly and sometimes breathtakingly . . . <br>"His vast but miniaturist genius is for seeing the enormous in the tiny, the significant in the silent, the horror-filled in the mute, the voicelessly poetic in almost everything."<br>--Kirkus ReviewsJason Schwartz&#39;s stories have been published in numerous journals, including Conjunctions, Exact Change Yearbook, The Quarterly, and StoryQuarterly.

Set in London, Cairo, Amsterdam, and Washington, the story line follows CIA case agent Michael Osbourne as he attempts to locate the terrorists who shot down an airliner off the coast of Long Island. Osbourne has two main antagonists: Delaroche, a KGB-trained expert assassin ordered to kill the handful of people who know the truth, including Osbourne, and the corrupt political culture of Washington, which ominously stymies him at every turn. There's a love story at the core of this book, as well as a brave attempt by Osbourne to reconcile a mystery in his past with a present he has not fully accepted. The prose is slick, and readers will find themselves racing through these pages as the body count grows and the conclusion nears. <i>The Mark of the Assassin</i> is a worthy effort from a rising star."Filled with the kind of dark passages that keep fans of spy thrillers guessing as they eagerly turn the pages . . . briskly suspenseful, tightly constructed, and full of well-rounded, believable characters . . . reminiscent of John le Carr�'s classic The Spy Who Came In from the Cold."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Richard Bernstein, The New York Times<br><br>"A first novel of remarkable ingenuity and daring that reignites our enthusiasm for World War II skullduggery.

He also spent fascinating days, sometimes longer, with inspiring leaders like Sargent Shriver, Bobby Kennedy, George McGovern, Jack Kemp, V�clav Havel, President Reagan, Lady Thatcher, and Pope John Paul II, who helped shape&#x2014;and reshape&#x2014;his political views.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet through it all, as Novak&#x2019;s sharply etched memoir shows, his focus on helping the poor and defending universal human rights remained constant; he gradually came to see building small businesses and envy-free democracies as the only realistic way to build free societies. Without economic growth from the bottom up, democracies are not stable. Without protections for liberties of conscience and economic creativity, democracies will fail. Free societies need three liberties in one: economic liberty, political liberty, and liberty of spirit.<br>&nbsp;<br>Novak&#x2019;s writing throughout is warm, fast paced, and often very beautiful.

What prompted you to write this book?</strong></p> <p>A. My 80th birthday, gratitude to Providence for a wonderfully eventful life, sadness for things not done well, joy in the hundred tough battles fought.</p> <p><strong>Q. What do you hope to accomplish with this book?</strong></p> <p>A. Allow others to meet the great persons &#x2013; George McGovern, Sarge Shriver, President Reagan, Prime Minister Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, and many others &#x2013; it was my joy to spend some time with.</p> <p><strong>Q. You are known as an important voice in American Catholicism. What role has your faith played in your ideological evolution?</strong></p> <p>A. Yes, I am extremely grateful to the Catholic Church. And I hope I have been an &#x201c;important voice&#x201d; in the whole of American life, too, because I am very grateful to this country. As Tocqueville predicted, Catholics might one day be the best interpreters of the American creed, and America might be a vibrant meeting place of Jewish-Christian religion and political liberty.</p> <p><strong>Q. Is there a person or experience that had a significant impact on the development of your faith?</strong></p> <p>A. My grandfather, my parents, the scores of my &#x201c;best friends who have been dead for many hundreds of years,&#x201d; whom I met through reading and study, and the many hundreds of others I&#x2019;ve been privileged to work with in person. Saints and sinners, both. As James Joyce wrote, &#x201c;Catholicism is &#x2018;here comes everybody!&#x2019;&#x201d; And America itself is the first country made up of every other people on earth, the first &#x201c;planetary&#x201d; nation.</p> <p><strong>Q. Who is the target audience for your book?</strong></p> <p>A. I hope all my friends and critics read it, and that millions and millions of others enjoy it!</p> <p><strong>Q. What are some of the highlights of the book?</strong></p> <p>A. Some of my favorites are the adventures of my days of reporting on the Vietnam War, the ups and downs of all the political campaigns I have participated in since 1960, the battles in the Catholic Church before, during, and after the Second Vatican Council (1962-65). I think there are some good, funny stories here, some crushing defeats, some heartwarming and joyful moments.</p> <p><strong>Q. Anything else you&#x2019;d like to add?</strong></p> <p>A. I hope this book represents a faithful witness to the tumultuous events of our country and the Church from 1960 through 2005. I have had a series of wonderful adventures, which Providence sent my way, usually unexpected. I hope this is a faithful mirror of our time, from a singular point of view.</p>MICHAEL NOVAK is one of the world's most influential living social philosophers.

Rejected by his parents, out of school and in trouble with the police, he claims for himself a new identity as a permanent outsider; he gets a crossed-bones tattoo on his arm, and takes the name "Bone."<p> He finds dangerous refuge with a group of biker-thieves, and then hides in the boarded-up summer house of a professor and his wife. He finally settles in an abandoned schoolbus with Rose, a child he rescues from a fast-talking pedophile. There Bone meets I-Man, an exiled Rastafarian, and together they begin a second adventure that takes the reader from Middle America to the ganja-growing mountains of Jamaica.

The proof? Wal-Mart is going green,&#x201d; introducing organic foods chainwide.

Perini also shares his award-winning tips preparing them, including his secrets to cooking the perfect steak - for selecting the cut, preparing it, knowing when to turn it, and when to call it done. Throughout, stunning photography, archival illustrations, and Perini's own dry, Texan wit bring to life the romance, adventure, character, and humor of life in cowboy country. <p>* Beautiful, artful photographs complemented by drawings of regional western art </p><p>* Written descriptions of historic Texas regions capture the romance of cowboy food and culture </p><p>* Showcases heritage food, with heirloom recipes and cowboy practicality complemented by modern kitchen shortcuts</p></p><p>What did cowboys eat on the range? It's doubtful their "chuck" much resembled the lively fare offered by restaurateur Tom Perini in <i>Texas Cowboy Cooking</i>, a collection of 75 recipes from the Perini Ranch Steakhouse. That said, the dishes, which include the likes of Black Bean and Roasted Corn Salad, Oven Roasted Beef Brisket, and Jessica's Favorite Green Chili Hominy, are just the thing when the call of meat and Tex-Mex seasoning can't be denied. Illustrated with color photos throughout, the book provides a big-food journey, noting en route the Texas lore that gives it context. Most readers will probably pass on the Calf Fries, a local delicacy the author hardly admits are made from beef testicles. But when Perini talks steak--offering useful cut information and such tempting dishes as a Spicy Beef Tenderloin with Roasted Garlic-Horseradish Cream, Round Steak Rolls, and Laredo Broil, a superior version of marinated flank steak--you'll want to pay attention. Other standouts include an exemplary Texas Chili, Winter Squash Soup, Grilled Sourdough with Texas Onion Butter (a recipe for the bread is included), Carrots with Bourbon Sauce, and the fancier Celebration Venison with Ginger and Wine. Desserts aren't neglected, and simple sweets like Grandmother's Pound Cake, Jane's Sweet Potato-Pecan Pie, and Bread Pudding with Whisky Sauce should put a happy end to whatever appetite is left after a massive Perini spread. With a short but interesting section on cowboy life and informative sidebars (such as Aging Beef), the book provides easily made, easily enjoyed food for millennial buckeroos everywhere. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>Buffalo Gap, Texas.

A hidden valley on the border of England and Wales preserves a longtime feud between two old border families as well as an ancient Templar church with a secret that may be linked to a famous ghost story.

An apparition resembling the ghost in M.R. James's short tale, Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad, has appeared at an abandoned house near the Welsh border that's to be restored by a trust connected with Prince Charles. When Felix Barlow, the builder set to do the renovation, complains about the ghost, the bishop of Hereford orders Watkins, a minister who specializes in exorcism cases, to investigate. After Barlow is found bludgeoned to death, suspicion falls on his beautiful assistant, Fuchsia Mary Linden, who appears to have committed suicide out of remorse. Doubtful of the official line, Watkins does her own digging. The writing and characterizations are first-rate, though Rickman gives away part of the game rather earlier than most mystery fans would like. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was best known for having popularized the use of mind-altering drugs in the 1960s.<br><br>Timothy Leary was born October 22, 1920, in Springfield, Massachusetts. He was educated at Holy Cross College, the U.S. Military Academy, the University of Alabama (A.B., 1943), Washington State University (M.S., 1946), and the University of California at Berkeley (Ph.D., 1950). During World War II, Leary served in the U.S. Army, achieving the rank of sergeant in the Medical Corps. Subsequently he was an assistant professor at the University of California; director of psychiatric research at the Kaiser Foundation, Oakland, California; and a lecturer in psychology at Harvard University.<br><br>Leary and colleague Alpert (Ram Dass) were expelled form Harvard for their LSD research with students. Leary and Alpert then founded the International Foundation for Internal Freedom (IFIF) to promote LSD and similar drugs. In 1965 Leary visited India and converted to Hinduism, announcing that his work was basically religious. The following year, IFIF headquarters at Millbrook, New York, was raided by local police under the direction of G. Gordon Liddy, later to become notorious himself as the iron man of the Watergate scandal.<br><br>Leary had been arrested for possessing a small quantity of marijuana in 1965 and again in 1968. He was given ten-year sentences on each count, to be served consecutively rather than concurrently. This harsh sentence was almost certainly a result of his notoriety, as it bore little relation to the offenses, which even then were not regarded as serious. After serving only six months, Leary, with the aid of the Weather Underground, a left-wing terrorist organization, escaped from prison. Thereafter, he resided in Algeria, Switzerland, and finally Afghanistan. In 1973 he was seized and returned to California, where he was given an additional sentence for his prison escape. Leary was not released from confinement until 1976.<br><br>Leary's last book, <i>Chaos and Cyber Culture</i> was a hypertext instruction book of sorts, proclaiming that "the pc is the lsd of the '90s." Leary even "wired" his own final days on his website (Leary.com) in word and image. Leary surrounded himself with friends, famous and otherwise, as well. As Gen X chronicler and longtime friend of Leary, Douglas Rushkoff wrote in Esquire, "On learning of his inoperable prostate cancer, Tim realized he was smack in the middle of another great taboo: dying. True to character, he wasn't about to surrender to the fear and shame we associate with death in modern times. No, this was going to be a party." Originally, Leary had planned to have his brain cryogenically frozen, but decided instead to have his ashes shot into space. Leary died in Beverly Hills, CA, on May 31, 1996. His last words: "why not?"For several thousand years it has seemed obvious that the basic nature of the universe is extreme complexity, inexplicable disorder-that mysterious, tanked magnificence popularly known as Chaos. <p>The poetic Hindus believed the universe was a dreamy dance of illusion (maya). </p><p>Individualistic thinking is the orighinal sin of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic bibles and sabotages attempts by the authorities to order Chaos. </p><p>The first rule of every law-and-order system is to trivialize-daemonize the dangerous concepts of Self, Individual Aims, and Personal Knowledge. Thinking for Your Selves is heretical, treasonous, blasphemous. Only devils and satans do it. Creative thinking, committed out loud, becomes a capital crime. It was Three Strikes and Youre Out for several hundred thousand Protestant dissenter during the Inquisitions of the Roman papacy-not to forget the witch-burnings performed by the Protestants when they took charge of the Chaos-control department.</p></p><h2>Living Free - Bible Study Book: Learning to Pray God&#39;s Word</h2><p><p><b>Living Free: Learning to Pray God's Word</b> by <b>Beth Moore</b> provides a personal study experience for five days a week for six weeks of Bible study.

It seems probable that, within the warm saltiness of the primeval sea, certain organic substances were fashioned from carbon dioxide, sulphur, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and calcium. Perhaps these were transition steps from which the complex molecules of protoplasm arose-molecules that somehow acquired the ability to reproduce themselves and begin the endless stream of life. It is doubtful that the first life possessed the substance chlorophyll, with which plants in sunlight transform lifeless chemicals into the living stuff of their tissues. Little sunshine could enter their dim world, penetrating the cloud banks from which fell the endless rains. Probably the sea&#39;s first children lived on the organic substances then present in the ocean waters, or, like the iron and sulphur bacteria that exist today, lived directly on inorganic food.</p><h2>The Other Side of the Bridge</h2><p>From the author of the beloved #1 national bestseller <b>Crow Lake </b>comes an exceptional new novel of jealously, rivalry and the dangerous power of obsession.<br><br>Two brothers, Arthur and Jake Dunn, are the sons of a farmer in the mid-1930s, when life is tough and another world war is looming. Arthur is reticent, solid, dutiful and set to inherit the farm and his father&#x2019;s character; Jake is younger, attractive, mercurial and dangerous to know &#x2013; the family misfit. When a beautiful young woman comes into the community, the fragile balance of sibling rivalry tips over the edge.<br><br>Then there is Ian, the family&#x2019;s next generation, and far too sure he knows the difference between right and wrong. By now it is the fifties, and the world has changed &#x2013; a little, but not enough. <br><br>These two generations in the small town of Struan, Ontario, are tragically interlocked, linked by fate and community but separated by a war which devours its young men &#x2013; its unimaginable horror reaching right into the heart of this remote corner of an empire. With her astonishing ability to turn the ratchet of tension slowly and delicately, Lawson builds their story to a shocking climax. Taut with apprehension, surprising us with moments of tenderness and humour, <b>The Other Side of the Bridge</b> is a compelling, humane and vividly evoked novel with an irresistible emotional undertow.<br><br><i>Arthur found himself staring down at the knife embedded in his foot. There was a surreal split second before the blood started to well up and then up it came, dark and thick as syrup. <br><br>Arthur looked at Jake and saw that he was staring at the knife. His expression was one of surprise, and this was something that Arthur wondered about later too. Was Jake surprised because he had never considered the possibility that he might be a less than perfect shot? Did he have that much confidence in himself, that little self-doubt? <br><br>Or was he merely surprised at how easy it was to give in to an impulse, and carry through the thought which lay in your mind? Simply to do whatever you wanted to do, and damn the consequences.</i><br>&#x2013;from <b>The Other Side of the Bridge</b></p><p>Mary Lawson was born and brought up in a farming community in central Ontario. She moved to England in 1968, is married with two sons and lives in Kingston-upon-Thames. This is her second novel.Prologue<br><br>There was a summer back when they were kids, when Arthur Dunn was thirteen or fourteen and his brother, Jake, was eight or nine, when for weeks on end Jake pestered Arthur to play the game he called knives. Jake had a great collection of knives at the time, everything from fancy little Swiss Army jackknives with dozens of attachments to a big sleek hunting knife with a runnel down one side for blood. It was the hunting knife that was to be used in the game because according to Jake it was the best for throwing.<br><br>&#x201c;Just once, okay?&#x201d; Jake would say, dancing about barefoot in the dust of the farmyard, tossing the knife from hand to hand like a juggler, leaping back quickly if it decided to fall blade-first. &#x201c;Come on, just once. It&#x2019;ll only take a <i>minute</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m busy,&#x201d; Arthur would say, and carry on with whatever task his father had set him to. It was the summer holidays and the list of tasks was unending, but it was better than going to school.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Jake would say. &#x201c;Come <i>on</i>. You&#x2019;ll <i>love </i>it! It&#x2019;s a really good game. Come <i>on</i>!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I gotta fix this hinge.&#x201d;<br><br>Jake had explained the rules of the knife game to him and it was crazy. You stood at attention facing each other, about six feet apart, and took turns throwing the knife into the ground as close as possible to your opponent&#x2019;s naked foot. You had to be barefoot, Jake explained, or there would be no point to the game. Wherever the knife landed, your opponent had to move his foot alongside it. The idea was to make him do the splits bit by bit, as slowly as possible. The more throws the better. The smaller the distance between the still-vibrating steel and the outer edge of your brother&#x2019;s foot, the better. Nuts.<br><br>But in the end, as they had both known he would, Jake wore Arthur down. That was Jake&#x2019;s specialty&#x2013;wearing people down.<br><br>It was a warm evening in July, the end of a long hot day out in the fields, and Arthur was sitting on the back step doing nothing, which was always a mistake. Jake appeared around the corner of the house and saw him, and his eyes started to shine. Jake had dark blue eyes in a pale triangular face and hair the colour of wheat. At nine years old he was slight and reedy (<i>frail</i> was the word their mother used) and already good-looking, though not as good-looking as he would be later. Arthur, five years older, was big and slow and heavy, with sloping shoulders and a neck like an ox.<br><br>Jake had the knife on him, of course. He always did; he carried it around in its own special sheath with its own special belt-loop, so as to be ready for anything. He started badgering Arthur right away, and eventually Arthur gave in just to get it over with.<br><br>&#x201c;Once, okay?&#x201d; Arthur said. &#x201c;<i>Once</i>. I play it once, now, and you never ask me again. Promise.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, okay, I promise! Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br>And so it was that on that warm July evening when he was thirteen or fourteen years old&#x2013;at any rate plenty old enough to know better &#x2013; Arthur found himself standing behind the line his little brother had drawn in the dust, waiting to have a knife thrown at his bare and vulnerable feet. The dust felt hot, warmer than the air, and soft as talcum powder. It puffed up between his toes every time he took a step and turned them a pale and ghostly grey. Arthur&#x2019;s feet were broad and meaty with red raw patches from his heavy farm boots. Jake&#x2019;s feet were long and thin, delicate and blue-veined. Jake didn&#x2019;t wear farm boots much. He was considered by their mother to be too young for farm labour, though Arthur hadn&#x2019;t been too young at the same age.<br><br>Jake had first throw, by virtue of it being his game and his knife. &#x201c;Stand at attention,&#x201d; he said. His eyes were fixed on Arthur&#x2019;s left foot and he spoke in a hushed voice. He had a great feeling for the drama of the moment, had Jake. &#x201c;Keep your feet together. Don&#x2019;t move them, no matter what.&#x201d;<br><br>He took the knife by the blade and began swinging it loosely between finger and thumb. His forefinger rested easily in the blood runnel. He seemed scarcely to be holding the knife at all. Arthur watched the blade. In spite of himself, he felt his left foot curl inwards.<br><br>&#x201c;Keep it still,&#x201d; Jake said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m warning you.&#x201d;<br><br>Arthur forced his foot to lie flat. The thought came into his mind&#x2013;not drifting gently in but appearing suddenly, fully formed, like a cold hard round little pebble &#x2013; that Jake hated him. The thought had never occurred to him before but suddenly, there it was. Though he couldn&#x2019;t imagine a reason. Surely he was the one who should have done the hating.<br><br>The knife swung for a minute more, and then, in one swift graceful movement, Jake lifted his arm and threw, and the blade circled, drawing swift shining arcs in the air, and then buried itself deeply in the ground a couple of inches from the outside edge of Arthur&#x2019;s foot. A beautiful throw.<br>Jake&#x2019;s eyes left the ground and he grinned at Arthur. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Your turn. Move your foot out to the knife.&#x201d;<br><br>Arthur moved his foot outwards to the edge of the knife and drew the blade from the ground. The skin on the top of his left foot was stinging, though nothing had touched it. He straightened up. Jake stood facing him, still grinning, arms at his sides, feet together. Eyes bright. Excited, but without fear. Without fear because &#x2013; and Arthur saw this suddenly too &#x2013; Jake knew that Arthur would never risk throwing really close.<br>Arthur.</p><h2>Be Alive (John 1-12): Come to Better Know the Living Savior (The BE Series Commentary)</h2><p><p>During the months that I have been studying the Gospel of John and writing this book, I have felt like a man standing on holy ground. The more I studied and wrote, the more inadequate I felt. No wonder the great Greek scholar Dr. A.T. Robertson called the Gospel of John "the profoundest book in the world." <br> </p> <p>There is not space in these studies to plumb the depths, but I have tried to present the basic teachings of this marvelous book. The Gospel of John is simple enough for a child to wade in, but deep enough for the scholar and the most seasoned saint to swim in.<br> </p> <p>This book is the first of two volumes devoted to the Gospel of John. The second one, focusing on chapters 13-21, will follow.<br> </p> <p>Please come to this book with the heart and mind of a worshiper. John did not simply write a book; he painted exciting pictures. These pages are filled with images such as the Lamb, the Door, the Shepherd, the new birth, the light and darkness, the Water of Life, bread, blindness, seeds, and dozens more. Use your "sanctified imagination" as you study and the Gospel of John will become a new book to you. And, remember, you are not studying a book--you are seeing a Person.

Maps at the beginning of each book provide students with a frame of reference while a list of important dates offers a context in which to place the culture. Rome describes only a brief moment in the history of the Roman Empire, the Augustan era at the height of the early Empire. Aztecs offers more of an overview of that relatively short-lived empire. Both books, however, provide a good, basic grounding in the cultures they describe. The texts are straightforward and descriptive, and relatively free of any judgmental tone. For example, Roman gladiators and the spectators' enjoyment of the competition is described without editorializing. Similarly, the brutality of the Aztecs' sacrificial practices is noted but not commented upon. A number of books offer a similar format--large, bright, and detailed illustrations combined with brief descriptive text. The gimmick here is the presence of clear acetate pages interspersed throughout each book that may be lifted to reveal the inner workings of the structures depicted. Even more useful is the fact that the captions are fully indexed along with the rest of the text. --Linda Greengrass, Bank Street College Library, NY<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Private Sector</h2><p>The bestselling author of Secret Sanction returns--and this time, Army lawyer Sean Drummond is loaned out to a law firm whose #1 client may have ties to a vicious serial killer and a massive international crime ring.Wherever Sean Drummond goes, it seems that the JAG officer leaves a trail of political fallout in his wake. So when his superiors get an opportunity to loan him to a prestigious law firm, they jump on it, hoping he&#39;ll soak up the nuances of civilian lawyering. But almost immediately, dark clouds appear when Sean&#39;s predecessor in the loan-out program is murdered. Then Sean begins to sense something amiss with the firm&#39;s biggest client, a telecom behemoth with large defense contracts. Now, he must survive in D.C.&#39;s buttoned-down lawyer culture long enough to stop the killer, and long enough to discover why his firm and its top client are willing to kill anyone who gets in their way.</p><p>Brian Haig lives in New Jersey with his wife and four children.Brian Haig, usually a master of the mystery novel, stumbles with his execution of this rambling story. A young Army JAG officer is sent to a prestigious Washington, D.C, law firm to broaden his horizons from criminal law to corporate law. His first day on the job convinces him that lazy civilians have little to offer him. When a colleague is murdered, he sets out to find the killer--against the wishes of almost everyone. Reader John Rubenstein does the best he can with the one-dimensional characters he attempts to bring to life but ends up disappointing readers almost as much as the story's flat, abrupt ending. Only Michael Emerson's voicing of the thoughts of the killer is eerily engaging, but it's too little too late.

In the Buryat Aga region, Black and White shamans conduct rituals together, for the Buryats believe that they are the children of the Swan Mother, descendants of heaven who can unite both sides in harmony. <br> <br>Providing an intimate account of one of the Buryats&#x2019; most important shamanic rituals, this book documents a complete <i>Shanar</i>, the ceremony in which a new shaman first contacts his ancestral spirits and receives his power. Through dozens of full-color photographs, the authors detail the preparations of the sacred grounds, ritual objects, and colorful costumes, including the <i>orgay</i>, or shaman&#x2019;s horns, and vividly illustrate the dynamic motions of the shamans as the spirits enter them. Readers experience the intensity of ancient ritual as the initiate struggles through the rites, encountering unexpected resistance from the spirit world, and the elder shamans uncover ancient grievances that must be addressed before the Shanar can be completed successfully. <br> <br>Interwoven with beautiful translations of Buryat ceremonial songs and chants, this unprecedented view of one of the world&#x2019;s oldest shamanic traditions allows readers to witness extraordinary forces at work in a ritual that culminates in a cleansing blessing from the heavens themselves.</p><p>Virlana Tkacz, the recipient of two Fulbright Fellowships, is director of the Yara Arts Group in New York.

The appointed place for the ritual was a large grassy meadow surrounded by gentle rolling hills. There were no shrines or temples. Here in the "lap of Nature," as old Buryats say, everything has a spirit--not only people and animals, but also trees, rivers, and mountains. A shaman mediates between the world of humans and the world of spirits. The spirits of nature help him in this process. <br> <br>The tree that the Buryats respect and call their "family tree" is the birch. During a ritual the birch is a conduit between people and the world of the spirits. In special places large birches were dug out with their roots, and smaller birch saplings were cut down at the root. They were brought to the ritual grounds with all their branches and leaves intact. Here they were decorated and set into the ground in a traditional pattern, as an offering to the spirits. <br> <br>Two birch groves were set up. At the south end the men dug a large hole for a tall, thin birch. This birch was the <i>Serge</i>, or the Hitching Post. <br> <br>The shamans at this ritual were both Black and White. Black and White in this case does not mean good and evil, but rather defines two different traditions of shamanism. A Black shaman beats a drum while chanting and calls on the spirits of the earth. White shamans ring a bell as they chant. Black shamanism is believed to have arisen in the Lake Baikal area. The origins of White shamanism are less clear. Some scholars believe that White shamanism contains fragments of an old Mesopotamian religion, brought to this area thousands of years ago. Others point to the obvious influence of Buddhism.<i> <br> <br>Black and White were united <br>For this full white </i>Shanar<i> <br></i> <br>In the Buryat Aga Region of Siberia, where the borders of Russia, Mongolia, and China come together, Black and White shamans conduct rituals together. The Buryats here are Khori Buryats, descendants of Khoridoi Mergen and the Mother Swan. They consider themselves to be Swan people--descendants of Heaven who can unite the Black and the White.<i> <br> <br></i>During this <i>Shanar </i>Black and White shamans took turns conducting the various rituals. The White shamans used the southern birch grove, while the Black shamans used the northern grove. Most of the shamans in Bayir's circle practice on both Black and White sides, but each shaman has a preference for one. Bayir, as the leader of the group, would usually choose the Black side, which is considered to be more powerful. The other Black shaman was Dulma Dashiyeva, a striking woman from Aga. The leader of the White side was the shamaness Seseg Balzhinimayeva. <br> <br>Bayir, Dulma, and Seseg, now all in their forties, started on the path to shamanism at the same time. Those were difficult times, since shamanism was forbidden under the Soviets. All religions were dubbed "the opiate of the people," but shamanism was considered a particularly odious form that prevented its "unenlightened practitioners" from joining the "progress on the road to socialism." Shamans were portrayed as insane or devilish. The anti-religion campaigns of the 1930s and 1950s were particularly harsh. In the Buryat Aga Region people tell many stories of shamans who defied the authorities, but eventually most were shot or disappeared into the labor camps of northern Siberia. <br> <br>Some shamans joined the exodus of Aga Buryats to Mongolia. Although Mongolia was a Soviet satellite state, the remote Buryat villages of Eastern Mongolia were far from government scrutiny. There the shamans were able to quietly continue their practices. With the easing of Soviet control Aga Buryats started to travel to these villages. Bayir, Seseg, and Dulma, who were then young shamans in search of a traditional mentor, were able to find an old shaman in a Buryat village in Mongolia who became their teacher. And so the ancient traditions, which had been in danger of being lost because of the seventy-year ban, were revived. <br> <br>Today times are good because people can openly display their belief in shamanism, but they are also very hard times economically. Seseg once taught kindergarten in her native village, but the government stopped paying teachers in remote villages. Seseg had to think about her family's survival. She decided to get a cow because, as she said, at least the children would always have milk on their lips. So Seseg, educated to be a teacher, now keeps a cow for a living and practices shamanism. Many other educated Buryat villagers were also forced by circumstances to return to their ancient traditional ways. <br> <br>In addition to Bayir, Dulma, and Seseg, there were several other shamans at the <i>Shanar </i>who were only starting on the path to shamanism. They served as assistants to the shamans during the ritual. There was Bato-Bolot, a middle-aged man who preferred to shamanize on the White side, and Tuyana, a young shamaness who preferred the Black side. Then there was the kindly elder Bolod-Akhe1 from the collective farms far to the south near the great lakes that border on Mongolia, and the beautiful Olya from Alkhanay who had only recently discovered her calling. <br> <br>The calling to become a shaman usually first appears as a very serious illness that seems incurable. It is known as shaman sickness. The person must acknowledge that the source of the illness is spiritual. They also must accept the fact that they will become a shaman and undergo a ritual before the illness disappears. <br> <br>The dedicating shaman at the <i>Shanar </i>was Volodya Zhaltsapov. He was the reason we were all there. He was the one who was bringing this <i>Shanar </i>to his ancestors.</p><h2>Medieval Messenger (Newspaper Histories Series)</h2><p>This is one in a series of books which presents facts about various periods in history through the use of a fictional tabloid newspaper.

Originally written for the popular French left press and then revised by the author into book form, <i>The Brown Plague</i> delivers a passionate warning to French workers about the terror and horror of fascism. Gu�rin chronicles the collapse of the German workers&#x2019; movement and reports on the beginnings of clandestine resistance to the Nazis. He also describes the Socialist and Communist leaderships&#x2019; inability to recognize the danger that led to their demise. Through vivid dialogs, interviews, and revealing descriptions of everyday life among the German people, he offers insight into the tragedy that was beginning to unfold. <br>Gu�rin&#x2019;s travels took him across the countryside and into the cities of Germany. He describes with extraordinary clarity, for example, his encounters with large groups of unemployed workers in Berlin and the spectacle of Goering presiding over the Reichstag. Staying in youth hostels, Gu�rin met individuals representing a range of various groups and movements, including the Wanderv�gel, leftist brigades, Hitler Youth, and the strange, semicriminal sexual underground of the Wild-frei. Devoting particular attention to the cultural politics of fascism and the lure of Nazism for Germany&#x2019;s disaffected youth, he describes the seductive rituals by which the Nazis were able to win over much of the population. As Robert Schwartzwald makes clear in his introduction, Gu�rin&#x2019;s interest in Germany at this time was driven, in part, by a homoerotic component that could not be stated explicitly in his published material. This excellent companion essay also places <i>The Brown Plague</i> within a broad historical and literary context while drawing connections between fascism, aesthetics, and sexuality. <br>Informed by an epic view of class struggle and an admiration for German culture, <i>The Brown Plague</i>, a notable primary source in the literature of modern Europe, provides a unique view onto the rise of Nazism.</p><p>&#34;Gracefully translated and generously introduced by Robert Schwartzwald, Daniel Guerin&#39;s &#34;The Brown Plague&#34; is a major document of its time. Though it offers a glimpse into a Left political culture that has, today, largely receded from view, the book&#39;s significance is far from merely commemorative. In its utopian political commitments and suffused homoerotic tonalities, &#34;The Brown Plague&#34; imagines a future that could, perhaps, be ours as well.&#34;--Andrew Parker, coeditor of &#34;Nationalisms and Sexualities&#34;<p>Daniel Gu�rin (1904&#x2013;1988) was the author of over forty books on a range of subjects including anarchism, decolonization, European and American workers&#x2019; movements, and the French Revolution.

She hopes Kendra will finally see the woman she has become.<br><br>But when a medical crisis threatens Jamie's health and her budding relationship with Kendra's builder, the enigmatic Cash Rosslyn, Jamie learns that the most difficult choice in her life is still ahead, and its cost may be beyond calculation.<br><br></p><p>Emilie Richards&#x2019;s many novels feature complex characterizations and in-depth explorations of social issues. Both are a result of her training and experience as a family counselor, which contribute to her fascination with relationships of all kinds. Emilie and her husband enjoy dividing their time between the Florida Gulf Coast and Chautauqua County, New York. She is currently working on her next novel for MIRA Books.<br><br>Jamie Dunkirk could sell almost anything. Maybe her talents hadn't always been put to the best uses, but in her twenty-nine years, she had proven her ability to make quick connections and convince likely targets they had to have whatever she was peddling. Without conceit, she knew that nobody was better at building excitement until a buyer was ready to take the plunge.<br><br>Still, nothing she had sold in all her years had been as difficult as selling Kendra and Isaac on her offer to carry their baby.<br><br>In the end, her sister and brother-in-law's deep yearning for a child, not her own expert salesmanship, had prevailed. They hadn't been easily swayed by words. They had considered and reconsidered all the things that could go wrong, then balanced them against the possibility of a baby, their very own baby, in their arms. The scales had been heavily tipped.<br><br>Now, if luck and Mother Nature did their part, one of the embryos a doctor had placed inside her three days ago was settling in for nine months of incredible changes. And when that baby emerged and she presented the squalling, sticky bundle to its rightful parents, Jamie knew she would finally have sold <em>herself the </em>most important commodity of all.<br><br>Forgiveness.<br><br>"Really!"<br><br>As so often happened, a living, breathing child interrupted Jamie's train of thought. "Really, we have to be there," Hannah said. "Are you sure we haven't passed it?"<br><br>Jamie glanced at the passenger seat of her minivan and saw that once again her older daughter was tracing their route on the Virginia map with her index finger. A callus was sure to develop before they arrived in Toms Brook.<br><br>"The exit is just ahead," Jamie said. "And Aunt Kendra's still following us. Right? Don't you think she would have called me on the cell phone if I passed the turn by mistake?"<br><br>Hannah looked frazzled, but Jamie couldn't blame her. Since the end of May, their lives had changed so drastically that even the adaptable Hannah hadn't been able to keep up. First they had terminated the lease on their house in Michigan&#x2014;the only home Hannah really remembered&#x2014; then they had packed their belongings and put most of them in storage. Finally Hannah and Alison had said goodbye to the friends and parents of friends who had peopled their little world. The future was a question mark, and even a whole week spent with Kendra and Isaac hadn't cured Hannah's anxiety about what was coming next.<br><br>Unfortunately that was just for starters. Hannah didn't know that her mother might be pregnant with her aunt and uncle's baby. There was plenty of time to tell her once the test was positive. The thought of explaining surrogacy to an eight-year-old, even one as mature and intelligent as Hannah, made Jamie long for the simplicity of the birds and the bees.<br><br>Hannah looked over her shoulder to see if Kendra really <em>was </em>following them. "I have to go to the bathroom."<br><br>"Which is why I suggested that you forgo that last juice box."<br><br>"Is there proof I wouldn't have to go now, if I had?" She sounded more interested than combative.<br><br>Hannah's analytical nature was Jamie's reward for sleeping with Hannah's father, a hotshot attorney. Larry Clousell wasn't often on the scene. He didn't like children and found parenting too complex to master in his brief interludes between high-profile court cases. Still, this little apple hadn't fallen far from the tree. More and more often Jamie saw flashes of Larry in their daughter, and she knew that before long, Hannah, too, would win every battle she engaged in. By the time Hannah was in college, no doubt Larry and Hannah would discover their similarities and become fast friends&#x2014; after he apologized for more or less abandoning her as a child. Until then, this verbal sparring was Jamie's penance.<br><br>"Hannah, what goes in must come out. That's a general rule of physics, and it applies here. We'll be there soon. You can wait."<br><br>"You're sure of that?"<br><br>Jamie lightly poked her in the arm. "Stop giving me a hard time. I'm tired, too."<br><br>"I liked the old cabin."<br><br>"You remember it?"<br><br>"Of course." Hannah rarely pouted, but now she was doing a reasonable imitation. "It had <em>character."</em><br><br>Jamie tried not to smile. "Well, now the new cabin will have characters. Two of them. You and Alison. And your aunt and uncle say it's very inviting."<br><br>"Do we have to live there if we don't like it?"<br><br>Jamie considered. "No."<br><br>"You're certain?"<br><br>"Who could be more certain? I'm in charge. There are plenty of other places to live. It's just that this makes sense, don't you think? The contractors are going to start building Uncle Isaac and Aunt Kendra's new house using the plans I drew for them. We can live in the cabin, and I can be there to learn some things and watch it go up."<br><br>"Why did the old one have to burn down?"<br><br>"Because somebody was careless with a cigarette. Another reason not to smoke."<br><br>"You smoked."<br><br>"And I quit."<br><br>"Forever?"<br><br>"I hope so."<br><br>"Why would you start again?"<br><br>Jamie wished they were already at the new cabin and the questions were finished. "Some things have a very strong pull, even when we know they're bad for us. That's why it's a good idea not to start bad habits. Not starting is pretty easy. Quitting is not."<br><br>"Like the people at First Step? The ones who are trying to quit using drugs?"<br><br>"You got it."<br><br>"Is there a list of things I shouldn't start? SoI will know?"<br><br>"You learn them along the way. And I'll be helping, so you don't have to worry."<br><br>"You might want to put them in writing. So I can check every once in a while."<br><br>"I'll take that under advisement."<br><br>"Alison is lucky. She can sleep anywhere. I want to sleep, too, only I have to go to the bathroom."<br><br>Jamie was delighted to see the Toms Brook exit sign. "Hold on, kiddo. We'll be there in a few minutes."<br><br>"That will be just about right." Hannah closed her eyes.<br><br>The trip down I-81 had been scenic enough to remind Jamie what was in store for her. But now, turning off the highway and pulling over to give Kendra the lead, she let the cool green of pastures and the rise of mist-shrouded mountains blunt the fears she hadn't shared with her daughter.<br><br>Jamie knew herself better than most people. She had spent a year as a client at First Step, a drug treatment program, then more years as a staff counselor. No professional played games with addicts, because nobody could ever beat one. Addicts were the ultimate gamesmen, so brutal truth was the rule of the day. Her fellow staff members had never been shy about ticking off a list of her faults. She was impulsive and idealistic. Her expectations, particularly of herself, were ridiculous. She was tactful when she should be forthright; she was too slow to give up on losers and too quick to forgive. She continually strove for absolution.<br><br>Ron Rosario, the director of First Step, had put it this way: "You're not ever going to be content, Jamie, not until you make some sacrifice so huge that even you'll feel you've made up for the bad times."<br><br>So, knowing what she did about herself, Jamie had considered, then reconsidered, the extraordinary idea of becoming Kendra and Isaac's surrogate.<br><br>She wasn't sure when the idea had taken root. In September, after visiting them and seeing how delighted they were to spend time with her daughters, she had caught an interview on a morning news show with a woman who had carried her infertile sister's baby.<br><br>The story hadn't shocked her. She'd felt as if a question had been answered, a miracle had been witnessed. Somewhere inside, she must have nurtured this possibility, even if the words hadn't surfaced. Because when she heard the woman recount the joys of giving her beloved sister a baby she could not bring into the world herself, Jamie had known, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that this was her mission, too.<br><br>But she was impulsive. She was prone to idealism. She knew it, had survived having it pounded into her psyche until she understood how she could be harmed by both. So she had researched. She had surfed Internet bulletin boards, spoken to a counselor at a local fertility clinic, consulted with her own doctor. She had scheduled a few personal sessions with Rosario&#x2014;which were guaranteed to knock the stuffing out of any bad idea. And in the end, the resolve that had formed while she watched that morning news show had grown even stronger.<br><br>She would do for Kendra what Kendra could not do for herself because of childhood injuries. She would carry her child. And when she was done, she would hand over the baby to her sister and brother-in-law, knowing that no couple would be better parents or love it more. Selfishly, she would know that she had helped create a cousin for her own daughters, who would never have one otherwise. Together, she and Kendra would raise their beautiful children to be healthy, happy adults. This new generation would have the start that she and Kendra had not. This would be a rebirth of the Dunkirk family.<br><br>"So, okay, that last part's a little over-the-top."<br><br>Hannah opened her eyes. "What?"<br><br>Jamie realized she had been muttering out loud. "See, we're at the <em>top </em>of the hill leading down to your aunt and uncle's land. We'll be there any minute."<br><br>Alison shrieked, not an uncommon occurrence when she first awoke from a nap.<br><br>"You might want to drive faster," Hannah advised.<br><br>"I want to get out!" Alison shrieked.<br><br>"Hold on tight." Jamie made noises of sympathy to her youngest and leaned on the accelerator.<br><br>Fitch Crossing Road had a Toms Brook address, but the tiny Virginia town was some distance away. The road was narrow and windy. Houses dotted the borders. Some had the shady, inviting front porches of another age, where inhabitants met in the evening to chat or tell stories; others were brick boxes that relied on air-conditioners for relief from the heat and television for entertainment. But no matter which they preferred, neighbors here relied on each other for help and support, rarely on elected or paid officials. Two years before, Kendra had moved here for several months and had made a number of friends.<br><br>Although the cabin where Kendra had retreated no longer stood, plans to live permanently on the property had survived. Now Kendra and Isaac wanted to begin rebuilding, with an eye toward moving here in the near future. Kendra hoped to use her experience as an investigative reporter at the <em>Washington Post </em>to freelance or work on a book, and Isaac, who was the head of a fledgling environmental group that concentrated on the health of the nation's rivers, hoped to move his office here, to the doorstep of the Shenandoah River, one of the waterways that needed his assistance.<br><br>Kendra braked, and Jamie followed suit. Then she trailed her sister down a long drive and slowed to a crawl.<br><br>"The driveway's a lot better. I think they've widened it. They've certainly graded it, and this looks like brand-new gravel."<br><br>"Gravel will be hard to ride a bike on."<br><br>Hannah had learned the rudiments of bike riding, but she was still prone to the occasional spill. Jamie had to agree. Spills on gravel would be lethal.<br><br>"We'll find good places for you to ride," she promised.<br><br>"Will there be anybody to play with?"<br><br>"If there isn't, I'll pick up your friends and bring them here."<br><br>"How will I make friends when it's already summer?"<br><br>"The neighbors are nice. I wouldn't worry too much. We'll find friends."<br><br>But even as she spoke, Jamie wondered how she and the girls would be greeted. Unless Kendra was completely open with the locals about the surrogacy, Jamie would simply appear to be an unwed mother. Having twice earned that title the normal way, she knew that not everybody would accept her or her children. For some people, the way a child came into the world was far more important than the child itself.<br><br>But even if the truth was widely known, there would still be people who felt what she was doing was unnatural and therefore wrong. They would not see that the act of giving birth to her sister's child was an expression of love, a family miracle. She just hoped those people would keep to themselves and not upset her daughters.<br><br>Kendra pulled to a stop before Jamie expected. The ruins of the old cabin were gone, and Kendra parked in the clearing near where they'd been. To Jamie's surprise, the new cabin that she had designed for her sister was nowhere in sight, although she had envisioned it on the western edge of the Taylors' property.<br><br>She turned off the engine and got out, then opened a rear door to help Alison out of her seat. "Did you forget to tell me something?" she called to Kendra.<br><br>Kendra slammed her door and started toward the van. Sunlight picked out the subtle red highlights in a wealth of brown curls. She was poised and elegant, despite freckles and a generous mouth. Kendra would look equally at home on a polo pony or a yacht, but Jamie knew that what seemed to be an aloof sophistication was just a barrier she erected to keep trespassers away.<br><br>Now Kendra snapped her fingers. "Oh, darn, I forgot. We didn't build your cabin after all. I guess you and the girls will have to camp out."<br><br>Hannah's eyes were wide. "Is there a tent large enough?"<br><br>Kendra ruffled her niece's hair. "I was just teasing your mom. There is a cabin, but don't worry, if you want to sleep in a tent some night, I'll come down and camp with you."<br><br>"Alison will want to come, too, and she is often afraid of noises." Hannah eyed her sister, who was rubbing her eyes. "We could wait until she's asleep."<br><br>"Oh, I think I have a tent big and safe enough for all of us."<br><br>"So what did you do with the cabin?" Jamie's curiosity was simmering.<br><br>"I think you'll be pleased." Kendra pointed to a road winding through the woods that bordered the clearing. "We can drive right up to the front door, or we can walk and stretch our legs."<br><br><em>"Little House in the Big Woods," </em>Hannah said. "Like the book."<br><br>"This is more like <em>Little House in the Tiny Woods." </em>Kendra draped an arm over her niece's shoulders. "These woods were cleared sometime in recent history for timber, so there weren't a lot of big trees to worry about when we selected a site for the cabin. We cleared away the scrub and left the nicest trees in place. I think you'll love the view. You can see the river below."<br><br>"Hannah, you'll be okay?" Jamie asked, remembering their bathroom conversation. But Hannah nodded enthusiastically.<br><br>They didn't have to walk for long. The road wound to the right, and a clearing opened up in front of them. Perched in the center was the cabin.<br><br>"And here's your mommy's masterpiece," Kendra said.<br><br></p><h2>Chilton&#39;s Auto Repair Manual 1940-1953, Collector&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Covers most popular American cars.</p><p></p><h2>How It Works In the Country</h2><p>How It Works In the Country, Walt Disney</p><p></p><h2>Winding Ways Quilts: A Practically Pinless Approach</h2><p>You!ll love this simple new technique.

Soon young Rodney followed in Dad's stumbling steps, beginning a lifetime of alcohol abuse.</p><p>King had been drinking the night of March 3, 1991, when he engaged in a high-speed chase with the LAPD, who finally pulled him over. What happened next shocked the nation. A group of officers brutally beat King with their metal batons, Tasered and kicked him into submission&#x2014;all caught on videotape by a nearby resident. The infamous Rodney King Incident was born when this first instance of citizen surveillance revealed a shocking moment of police brutality, a horrific scene that stunned and riveted the nation via the evening news. Racial tensions long smoldering in L.A. ignited into a firestorm thirteen months later when four white officers were acquitted by a mostly white jury. Los Angeles was engulfed in flames as people rioted in the streets. More than fifty people were dead, hundreds were hospitalized, and countless homes and businesses were destroyed.</p><p>King's plaintive question, "Can we all just get along?" became a sincere but haunting plea for reconciliation that reflected the heartbreak and despair caused by America's racial discord in the early 1990s.</p><p>While Rodney King is now an icon, he is by no means an angel. King has had run-ins with the law and continues a lifelong struggle with alcohol addiction. But King refuses to be bitter about the crippling emotional and physical damage that was inflicted upon him that night in 1991. While this nation has made strides during those twenty years to heal, so has Rodney King, and his inspiring story can teach us all lessons about forgiveness, redemption, and renewal, both as individuals and as a nation.</p></p><p><p>Rodney Glen King is known for being the victim in a notorious police brutality case with the Los Angeles Police Department on March 3, 1991. King was born in Sacramento, California, to Odessa King. His father, Ronald King, an alcoholic, died at age forty-two. King grew up in Pasadena, California. In 2008, King was a cast member on VH1's second season of <em>Celebrity Rehab</em>, a popular TV show hosted by Dr. Drew Pinsky that seeks to help celebrities become clean and sober. </p><br><br><p>Lawrence J.

Although the beleaguered spook has plenty of intrigue to deal with, this installment seems more diffuse and less plot-driven than its predecessors. Still, Deighton fans will probably enjoy the resolution of several outstanding cliffhangers, including the likelihood of a decent retirement package for the protagonist.Born in London, he served in the RAF before graduating from the Royal College of Art (which recently elected him a Senior Fellow). While in New York City working as a magazine illustrator he began writing his first novel, &#39;The Ipcress File&#39;, which was published in 1962.

At present living in Europe, he has, over the years, lived with his family in ten different countries from Austria to Portugal.</p><h2>Annabel</h2><p>In 1968, into the beautiful, spare environment of remote coastal Labrador, a mysterious child is born: a baby who appears to be neither fully boy nor girl, but both at once. Only three people are privy to the secret _ the baby&#39;s parents, Jacinta and Treadway, and a trusted neighbour, Thomasina. Together the adults make a difficult decision: to raise the child as a boy named Wayne. But as Wayne grows to adulthood within the hyper-masculine hunting culture of his father, his shadow-self _ a girl he thinks of as &#34;Annabel&#34; _ is never entirely extinguished, and indeed is secretly nurtured by the women in his life. Haunting, sweeping in scope, and stylistically reminiscent of Jeffrey Eugenides&#39; Middlesex, Annabel is a compelling tale about one person&#39;s struggle to discover the truth about their birth and self in a culture that shuns contradiction.</p><p></p><h2>Thud Ridge</h2><p>This is the story of a special breed of warrior, the fighter-bomber pilot; the story of valiant men who flew the F-105 Thunderchief Thud Fighter-Bomber over the hostile skies of North Vietnam.</p><p><p>Colonel Jack Broughton, was awarded the Air Force Cross (second only to the Medal of Honor) for his service in the Vietnam air wars.

Originally published in 1969 when the combat experiences of the Vietnam War were still happening in real-time, <i>Thud Ridge</i> tells the frustrating tale of Air Force strike pilots who were thrust into the war in its early stages, and who had to literally write the book as they flew each dangerous and hair-raising mission. Jack Broughton is not only a fighter pilot s fighter pilot, but a gifted write who can put you right into the hot sweaty cockpit of a Republic F-105 Thunderchief flying its payload of 750-lb. bombs right up Route Pack 6 and into the heavily defended piece of real estate that gives this book its name. &nbsp; Now enhanced by compelling and candid photographs running chronologically through the narrative, this book not only tells the story of aerial bravery during the early phases of Vietnam, but gives the reader a veritable encyclopedia of information on all the combat hardware employed in the conflict. An appendix showing aircraft flown and equipment used in Southeast Asia offers the kind of detail that really puts this book into proper historical perspective. Whether or not you were captivated by the original, this new release serves as a valuable re-visit to a pivotal era in military history that changed the face of aerial combat as we knew it. There are few people on this earth better suited to tell the story than Col. Jack Broughton. --Wings &amp; Airpower Magazine, December 200</p><h2>The Wonderful World of Netsuke: With 100 Masterpieces of Miniature Sculpture in Color</h2><p>We sell Rare, out-of-print, uncommon, &amp; used BOOKS, PRINTS, MAPS, DOCUMENTS, AND EPHEMERA.

But even as the newcomers set up camp and set the stage for <i>Jack and the Beanstalk</i>, there are signs that something just isn&#x2019;t right: Nialla&#x2019;s strange bruises and solitary cries in the churchyard, Rupert&#x2019;s unexplained disappearances and a violent argument with his BBC producer, the disturbing atmosphere at Culverhouse Farm, and the peculiar goings-on in nearby Gibbet Wood &#x2014; where young Robin Ingleby was found hanging just five years before.<br><br>It&#x2019;s enough to set Flavia&#x2019;s detective instincts tingling and her chemistry lab humming. What are Rupert and Nialla trying to hide? Why are Grace and Gordon Ingleby, Robin&#x2019;s still-grieving parents, acting so strangely? And what does Mad Meg mean when she says the Devil has come back to Gibbet Wood? Then it&#x2019;s showtime for Porson&#x2019;s Puppets at St. Tancred&#x2019;s &#x2014; but as Nialla plays Mother Goose, Rupert&#x2019;s goose gets cooked as the victim of an electrocution that is too perfectly planned to be an accident. Someone had set the stage for <i>murder</i>.<br><br>Putting down her sister-punishing experiments and picking up her trusty bicycle, Gladys, Flavia uncovers long-buried secrets of Bishop&#x2019;s Lacey, the seemingly idyllic village that is nevertheless home to a madwoman living in its woods, a prisoner-of-war with a soft spot for the English countryside, and two childless parents with a devastating secret. While the local police do their best to keep up with Flavia in solving Rupert&#x2019;s murder, his killer may pull Flavia in way over her head, to a startling discovery that reveals the chemical composition of vengeance.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: An Essay by Alan Bradley</strong> <br> <p> </p><p>Flavia de Luce walked into my life one winter day, parked herself on a campstool, and refused to be budged.</p> <p>It took me quite a while to realize that she wasn&#x2019;t even faintly interested in the mystery novel I was attempting to write at the time: the one into which she had wandered. I found out quickly enough that Flavia wanted her own book--and that was that.</p> <p>And it was just the beginning. There were still more problems to come.</p> <p>The first was this: Flavia lived in 1950, while I was writing about her in 2006 and 2007.</p> <p>As an author, it&#x2019;s not as easy as you might think projecting--and keeping--your mind in a different century from your body--not without forever being yanked back into the present by everyday annoyances such as frozen water pipes, expiring license plates, incessantly barking dogs, and the need to shop for food.</p> <p>Another problem was this: I lived on Canada&#x2019;s west coast, where the clocks are set to Pacific Time, while Flavia lived in Bishop&#x2019;s Lacey, England, which is on Greenwich Mean Time--a difference of nine hours. In practical terms, this meant that Flavia was raring to go every day just as I was getting ready for bed. Because there was no point in either of us being tired and cranky, we finally managed to work out a compromise in which I began awakening at 4:00 a.m. to write, while Flavia (rather impatiently) hung around until after lunch, waiting for me to show up.</p> <p>As <i>The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie</i> progressed, I soon learned that Flavia wouldn&#x2019;t be pushed around--especially by me. Because she had so many of her own ideas, she had little patience with mine. Occasionally, if I were tired, I&#x2019;d find myself trying to put words in her mouth: to push her, as it were. But Flavia would have none of it.</p> <p>"Blot that," she seemed to be saying. "Let&#x2019;s back up and start again."</p> <p>And of course we did.</p> <p>Then there was the problem of the chemistry. While Flavia knew everything about chemistry that could be known, my own knowledge of the subject could be put into a thimble with room left over for a finger. If I protested that I was in doubt about the precise details of one of her more bizarre chemical experiments, Flavia would snap her metaphorical fingers and say, "Well, you can look it up in your spare time."</p> <p>Almost from the outset I realized that the tale Flavia had to tell could never be contained in a single book. And that&#x2019;s how the series was born. Fortunately, my editors were in total agreement!</p> <p>We liked the idea of each book revolving around some now-vanished English custom, or way of life, and of being able, gradually, to get to know the de Luce family, giving each of them the time and the space to--eventually--tell his or her own story.</p> <p>Of course, to convey authentic 1950s voices, the pacing would have to be slower than we are used to in the 21st century. On the other hand, a more relaxed narrative would allow for an additional overall richness of description that might not be found in a more breakneck series of thrillers.</p> <p>But I needn&#x2019;t have worried: Flavia had her own voice and insisted on being listened to.</p> <p>It was I who had to do the learning. <em>--Alan Bradley</em></p> <p>(Photo � Shirley Bradley)</p>Alan Bradley was born in Toronto and grew up in Cobourg, Ontario. With an education in electronic engineering, Alan worked at numerous radio and television stations in Ontario, and at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now Ryerson University) in Toronto, before becoming Director of Television Engineering in the media centre at the University of Saskatchewan, where he worked for twenty-five years before taking early retirement in 1994.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Bradley was the first President of the Saskatoon Writers, and a founding member of the Saskatchewan Writers Guild. His children&#x2019;s stories were published in <i>The Canadian Children&#x2019;s Annual</i> and his short story &#x201c;Meet Miss Mullen&#x201d; was the first recipient of the Saskatchewan Writers Guild Award for Children&#x2019;s Literature.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>For a number of years, Alan regularly taught scriptwriting and television production courses at the University of Saskatchewan. His fiction has been published in literary journals and he has given many public readings in schools and galleries. His short stories have been broadcast by CBC Radio, and his lifestyle and humour pieces have appeared in <i>The Globe and Mail</i> and <i>The National Post</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Alan Bradley was also a founding member of The Casebook of Saskatoon, a society devoted to the study of Sherlock Holmes and Sherlockian writings. There, he met the late Dr. William A.S. Sarjeant, with whom he collaborated on the classic book <b>Ms. Holmes of Baker Street</b> (1989). This work put forth the startling theory that the Great Detective was a woman, and was greeted upon publication with what has been described as &#x201c;a firestorm of controversy.&#x201d; As he&#x2019;s explained in interviews, Bradley was always an avid reader of mysteries, even as a child: &#x201c;My grandmother used to press them upon us when we were very young. One of the first books she gave me was Dorothy L. Sayers&#x2019; <b>Busman&#x2019;s Holiday</b>. I was profoundly influenced by it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Upon retirement, Bradley began writing full time. His next book, <b>The Shoebox Bible</b> (2006), has been compared with <b>Tuesdays With Morrie</b> and <b>Mister God, This is Anna</b>. In this beautiful memoir, Bradley tells the story of his early life in southern Ontario, and paints a vivid portrait of his mother, a strong and inspirational woman who struggled to raise three children on her own during tough times.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In July of 2007, Bradley won the Debut Dagger Award from the British Crime Writers&#x2019; Association for <b>The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie</b> (2009), based on a sample that would become the first novel in a series featuring eleven-year-old Flavia de Luce. As Bradley has explained, it was the character of Flavia that inspired him to embark upon the project: &#x201c;I started to write <b>The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie</b> in the spring of 2006. Flavia walked into another novel I was writing as an incidental character, and she hijacked the book. Although I didn&#x2019;t finish that book, Flavia stuck with me.&#x201d; The Dagger award brought international attention to Bradley&#x2019;s fiction debut, and <b>Sweetness</b> and the additional novels planned for the series will be published in twenty-eight languages and in more than thirty countries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Alan Bradley lives in Malta with his wife Shirley and two calculating cats.

Visit her website at www.SusanWiggs.com.Moments before the wedding was to begin, Sonnet Romano shuddered with a wave of nervousness. "Mom," she said, hurrying over to the window, which framed a view of Willow Lake, "what if I screw up?"<br><br>Her mother turned from the window. The late afternoon light shrouded Nina Bellamy's slender form, and for a moment she appeared ethereal and as young as Sonnet herself. Nina looked fantastic in her autumn-gold silk sheath, her dark hair swept back into a low chignon. Only someone who knew her the way Sonnet did might notice the subtle lines of fatigue around her eyes and mouth, the vague puffiness of her skin. Just prior to the wedding, she'd attended the funeral, up in Albany, of her favorite aunt, who had died the week before of cancer, and the grief of goodbye lingered in her face.<br><br>"You're not going to screw up," Nina said. "You're going to be fabulous. You look amazing in that dress, you've memorized everything you're going to do and say, and it's going to be a wonderful evening."<br><br>"Yes, but&#x2014;"<br><br>"Remember what I used to say when you were little&#x2014;your smile is my sunshine."<br><br>"I remember." And the memory did its magic, bringing a smile to her face. Her mom had raised Sonnet alone, but only now that she was grown did she appreciate how hard that had been for Nina. "You gave me lots of memories, Mom."<br><br>"Come here, you." Nina opened her arms and Sonnet gratefully slipped into her mother's embrace.<br><br>"This feels nice. I wish I had a chance to come back here more often." Sonnet turned her face to the warm breeze blowing in through the window. The sheer beauty of the lake, nestled between the gentle swells of the Catskills, made her heart ache. Though she'd grown up in Avalon, the place felt foreign to Sonnet now, a world she used to inhabit and couldn't wait to leave.<br><br>Despite her vivid memories of her childhood here, playing in the woods with her friends or sledding down the hills in winter, she'd never truly appreciated the scenery until she'd left it behind, eager to find her life far away. Now that she lived in Manhattan, crammed into a closet-sized walk-up studio on a noisy East Side street, she finally understood the appeal of her old hometown.<br><br>"I wish you could, too," Nina said. "It's time-consuming, isn't it, saving the world?"<br><br>Sonnet chuckled. "Is that what I'm doing? Saving the world?"<br><br>"As a matter of fact, it is. Sweetie, I'm so proud to tell people you work with UNESCO, that your department saves children's lives all over the world."<br><br>"Ah, thanks, Mom. You make me think I do more than write emails and fill out forms." Sonnet often found herself wishing she could actually work with a child every once in a while. Buried in administrative chores, it was easy to forget.<br><br>On the smoothly-mown lawn below, guests were beginning to take their seats for the ceremony. Many of the groom's friends were in military dress uniform, adding a note of gravitas to the atmosphere.<br><br>"Wow," said Sonnet, "it's really happening, Mom. Finally."<br><br>"Yes," Nina agreed. "Finally."<br><br>A chorus of squeals came from the adjacent room, where the rest of the bridal party was getting ready.<br><br>"Daisy's going to be the prettiest bride ever," Sonnet said, feeling a thrum of emotion in her chest. The bride was Sonnet's best friend as well as her stepsister, and she was about to marry the love of her life. To Sonnet it felt like a dream come true...but also, deep in a hidden corner of her heart, a loss of sorts. Now someone else would be the keeper of Daisy's most private secrets, her soft place to fall, the person on the other end of the phone in the middle of the night.<br><br>"Until it's your turn," Nina said. "Then <i>you'll</i> be the prettiest bride ever."<br><br>Sonnet gave her mom's hand a squeeze. "Don't hold your breath. I'm busy saving the world, remember?"<br><br>"Just don't get so busy you forget to fall in love," Nina said.<br><br>Sonnet laughed. "I think you need to embroider that on a pillow. How about&#x2014;<i>Hello"</i> Her mind drained of everything but the sight of the tallest groomsman in the wedding party, escorting the grandmother of the bride to her seat in the front row.<br><br>In a dove-gray swallowtail tux, he moved with long-limbed grace, although his height was not the most striking thing about him. It was his hair, as long and pale as a banner of surrender, giving him the otherworldly look of a mythical creature. She couldn't take her eyes off him.<br><br>"Holy cow," she said. "Is that.?"<br><br>"Yep," said her mother. "Zach Alger."<br><br>"Whoa."<br><br>"He's finally grown into his looks, hasn't he?" Nina commented. "I'd forgotten how long it's been since you last saw him. The two of you used to be so close."<br><br>Zach Alger. Surely not, thought Sonnet, practically leaning out the open window. This couldn't be the Zach Alger she'd grown up with, the whiter-shade-of-pale boy who lived down the street, with his big goofy ears and braces on his teeth. Her best friend in high school, the freakishly skinny kid who worked at the Sky River Bakery. This couldn't be the college geek working his way through school, obsessed with cameras and all things video.<br><br>Zach Alger, she thought. Well, well. Since high school, he and Sonnet had gone in different directions, and she hadn't seen him in ages. Now she couldn't take her eyes off him.<br><br>After helping Daisy's grandmother to her seat, he pulled a flask from his tux pocket and took a swig. All right, thought Sonnet. <i>That</i> was the Zach she knew&#x2014;a guy with more talent than ambition, a guy with a troubled background he couldn't seem to shake, a guy who was part of her past, but had no possible place in her future.<br><br>Movement in the next room reminded her she had an important job to do today. She peered through the doorway at Daisy, who was surrounded by the hairstylist, makeup artist, wedding planner, her mom Sophie, the photographer and several people Sonnet didn't recognize. "What do you say?" she asked her mother. "Shall we go help Daisy get married?'<br><br>Nina grinned. "She wouldn't dare make a move without you."<br><br>"Or you. Honestly, when you married Daisy's dad, she hit the stepmom jackpot."<br><br>Nina's grin turned to a soft smile, and her dark eyes took on an expression that pulled Sonnet into days gone by, when it had just been the two of them, making their way in the world. Nina had turned a teenage pregnancy into a small but lovely life for herself and Sonnet. Yes, she was married now&#x2014;unexpectedly, in the middle of her life&#x2014;but their two-against-the-world time together belonged solely to Nina and Sonnet.<br><br>"You're going all mushy on me, aren't you?" Sonnet said.<br><br>"Yeah, baby. I am. Just wait until you're the bride. I'll need CPR." The shadows in the room were just starting to deepen; evening was coming on.<br><br>"No, you won't, Mom," Sonnet assured her. "You'll rise to the occasion. You always do."<br><br>Nina took her hand again, and together they stepped through the door.</p><h2>July 1914: Countdown to War</h2><p>When a Serbian-backed assassin gunned down Archduke Franz Ferdinand in late June 1914, the world seemed unmoved. Even Ferdinand's own uncle, Franz Josef I, was notably ambivalent about the death of the Hapsburg heir, saying simply, It is God's will.&#x201d; Certainly, there was nothing to suggest that the episode would lead to conflict much less a world war of such massive and horrific proportions that it would fundamentally reshape the course of human events.<br><br>As acclaimed historian Sean McMeekin reveals in <i>July 1914</i>, World War I might have been avoided entirely had it not been for a small group of statesmen who, in the month after the assassination, plotted to use Ferdinand's murder as the trigger for a long-awaited showdown in Europe. The primary culprits, moreover, have long escaped blame. While most accounts of the war's outbreak place the bulk of responsibility on German and Austro-Hungarian militarism, McMeekin draws on surprising new evidence from archives across Europe to show that the worst offenders were actually to be found in Russia and France, whose belligerence and duplicity ensured that war was inevitable. <br>Whether they plotted for war or rode the whirlwind nearly blind, each of the men involved from Austrian Foreign Minister Leopold von Berchtold and German Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov and French president Raymond Poincar� sought to capitalize on the fallout from Ferdinand's murder, unwittingly leading Europe toward the greatest cataclysm it had ever seen.<br><br>A revolutionary account of the genesis of World War I, <i>July 1914</i> tells the gripping story of Europe's countdown to war from the bloody opening act on June 28th to Britain's final plunge on August 4th, showing how a single month and a handful of men changed the course of the twentieth century.<br><br></p><p>Sean McMeekin is an assistant professor of history at Ko� University.

Assistant District Attorney Lisa Savitch has a problem. Her boss wants her to nail the Sunday Macaroni Club-five remnants of the old political machine led by Augie Sangiamino, a former U.S. Senator with a conviction for fraud, now a political consultant. Why are these has-beens so important when there are children in Philadelphia dying of leukemia in the vicinity of an oil refinery? As for Augie, it's like he says at grace on Sunday: "We thank you, Lord, for this wonderful macaroni dinner. But we could use a little help, to tell you the truth, in this campaign." His two candidates are way behind in the polls, and he needs a miracle, divine or otherwise, to reverse the trend. Miracles, of course, cost money, and that's where the Sunday Macaroni Club dives into a glorious-and usually hilarious-carnival of greed, ambition, and self-preservation. Its hoorifying politics are democracy in America, and few people understand those better than Steve Lopez or have more fun painting them large. The characters of The Sunday Macaroni Club spill off the page with a furious energy and unexpected decency-by turns appalling, alluring, and endearing, they are altogether unforgettable.<br></p><p>Steve Lopez is Senior Writer-at-large for Time Inc.This roman &#x2c6; clef of Philadelphia lowlife boasts sharp characterizations, a reporter's eye for detail and fascinating digression, buckets of local color and tubs of good-natured humor. The plot concerns an assistant D.A. who must set aside vital public business when ordered to pursue a gaggle of aging, no-longer-threatening mobsters. The tone is Runyunesque. Steven Bauer has a homely, slightly adenoidal voice with the gravelly sound of one on the last leg of a long debauch. The effect is appropriate and oddly winning. He has a lot of fun with the dialogue but gives some sloppy line readings of the narrative. Y.R.

In Gray&#39;s opinion, all works chosen deal with a search for self and ``enlighten the reader&#39;s own identity.&#39;&#39; He touches on theme, imagery, and structure; he also provides historical context. The bibliography cites the standard texts and includes suggested readings. A book most useful to students or general readers who want to know more about these great works, and an optional purchase.

The media and visual forms examined include lithography, photography, advertising, film, and theatrical performances. Urbanites actively engaged with and enjoyed this visual culture, which was largely driven by the subjective desire for the empty promises of modernity&#x2015;promises comprised of such abstract and fleeting concepts as new, exciting, and fashionable.</p><p>Detailing and analyzing the trajectories of development of various visual representations, Laikwan Pang emphasizes their interactions. In doing so, she demonstrates that visual modernity was not only a combination of independent cultural phenomena, but also a partially coherent sociocultural discourse whose influences were seen in different and collective parts of the culture. The work begins with an overall historical account and theorization of a new lithographic pictorial culture developing at the end of the nineteenth century and an examination of modernity&#x2019;s obsession with the investigation of the real. Subsequent chapters treat the fascination with the image of the female body in the new visual culture; entertainment venues in which this culture unfolded and was performed; how urbanites came to terms with and interacted with the new reality; and the production and reception of images, the dynamics between these two being a theme explored throughout the book.</p><p>Modernity, as the author shows, can be seen as spectacle. At the same time, she demonstrates that, although the excessiveness of this spectacle captivated the modern subject, it did not completely overwhelm or immobilize those who engaged with it. After all, she argues, they participated in and performed with this ephemeral visual culture in an attempt to come to terms with their own new, modern self.</p></p><p><b>Laikwan Pang</b> is associate professor in the Department of Cultural and Religious Studies, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.This book presents a careful historicization of the &#x2018;visual.&#x2019; Rather than take the act of seeing as natural, Pang brilliantly argues that the visual is a modern phenomenon, linked to but extending and transforming indigenous cultural forms of seeing and looking. Equally meticulous in its theoretical and empirical coordinates, this book is eminently readable and consistently insightful. A wonderful look at how modern Chinese came to see. Author: Rebecca E. Karl<br><br>Professor Pang has tackled one of the most exciting areas in modern Chinese studies, the dynamics of visuality. Through the kaleidoscopic prism of the Chinese encounter with modern visual apparatuses, she covers a wide range of issues, from the discourse of novelty to the technology of media and reproduction and beyond, in the politics of spectacle. The Distorting Mirror is a fascinating study of how Chinese were watching and being watched, at a crucial moment in modern history.

Originally published in 2004 amid the media circus surrounding The 9/11 Commission Report, it told more than a riveting tale&#x2014;it also provided an unflinching expos of failure, incompetence, and deceit at the highest levels of our government.<br><br>The Joint Inquiry, co-chaired by Senator Bob Graham (D-Florida), was the first and arguably most effective government body to investigate the horrendous 2001 attacks. Indeed, it helped compel a reluctant George W. Bush to establish the 9/11 Commission. But while both investigations sharply criticized the failures of our nation's intelligence establishment, only Graham's dared to challenge the Bush administration on a number of troubling points-especially the apparent complicity of Saudi officials in the events of 9/11, the subsequent protection provided by President Bush for a large number of Saudis (including members of the bin Laden family), and the run-up to the Iraq War, which Graham voted against. <br><br>The original work combined a compelling narrative of 9/11 with an insightful eyewitness chronicle of the Joint Inquiry's investigation, conclusions, and recommendations. Sharply critiquing the failures at the CIA, FBI, and the White House and detailing at least twelve occasions when the 9/11 plot could have been stopped, it concluded with a clear plan for overhauling our intelligence and national security establishment. For this paperback edition, Graham has added a substantial new preface and postscript that lucidly examine how effectively the nation has responded&#x2014;or failed to respond&#x2014;to the Joint Inquiry's recommendations. <br><br>This edition restores <i>Intelligence Matters</i> to its rightful place as one of the key texts on the subject of 9/11 and provides a grim reminder of the challenges that remain for us in the war on terror.</p><p>"A startling, authoritative book that should make you plenty angry. The outgrowth of an investigation your tax dollars paid for, it tells us that the government of Saudi Arabia had a central role in 9/11--and your government covered it up.

BOMC, QPB, History, &amp; Children's BOMC.</p><p>In tracing the evolution of the metropolis, architectural illustrator Albert Lorenz dazzles readers with his extraordinary visual depictions of some of the greatest defining moments in human history. Ranging from the pinnacles of human achievement in art, technology, and architecture to wars and plagues, we see how these forces have shaped our urban centers. Nineteenth-century London, for example, depicts the Industrial Revolution-age city, while 16th-century Florence is a center of refinement and enlightenment. We are led, ultimately, to the emergence of the modern mega-metropolis, 20th-century New York. Lorenz employs such illustrative techniques as aerial perspectives and cut-away views into buildings in order to capture as many details as possible. Each of the 10 mini-chapters is a visual realm unto itself; a completely illustrated timeline unites them. One of the most memorable illustrations is Lorenz&#39;s imagining of the countless artists and craftsmen building the glorious Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The full-color illustrations throughout effectively educate both kids and adults about art, culture, and architecture.A full-color time-traveling tour through ten cities. Lorenz recreates all the bustle and detail of 16th-century Florence, 17th- century Osaka, 18th-century Vienna, and 20th-century New York with an architect's eye for accuracy and elegance. His lavish spreads capture the main subject, e.g., the magnificence of a cathedral's interior, while close-up drawings on following pages focus on such details as gargoyles, a rose window, and stone sculpture, aptly showing how the parts form the whole. Most importantly, Lorenz conveys an architect's sense of how his subject ties into its surrounding environment on a human scale: The major drawings are framed by smaller illustrations commemorating battles fought and lost, the effects of disease, and facts on everyday economics. Those who relish the whimsy of Stephen Biesty's books may have to go elsewhere, for Lorenz relays a sober and accurate feeling of history and place. Others will find such sights as the aerial perspective of modern Manhattan--a dramatic view stretching from the edge of Central Park to the tops of the World Trade Center- -simply unforgettable.

Here is a literary love song that will entrance anyone who has lived in?or spent time?in the greatest of American cities.<b><br></b><br>A masterful evocation of the city that never sleeps, <i>The Colossus of New York</i> captures the city?s inner and outer landscapes in a series of vignettes, meditations, and personal memories. Colson Whitehead conveys with almost uncanny immediacy the feelings and thoughts of longtime residents and of newcomers who dream of making it their home; of those who have conquered its challenges; and of those who struggle against its cruelties. <br><br>Whitehead?s style is as multilayered and multifarious as New York itself: Switching from third person, to first person, to second person, he weaves individual voices into a jazzy musical composition that perfectly reflects the way we experience the city. There is a funny, knowing riff on what it feels like to arrive in New York for the first time; a lyrical meditation on how the city is transformed by an unexpected rain shower; and a wry look at the ferocious battle that is commuting. The plaintive notes of the lonely and dispossessed resound in one passage, while another captures those magical moments when the city seems to be talking directly to you, inviting you to become one with its rhythms. <br><br><i>The Colossus of New York</i> is a remarkable portrait of life in the big city.

Known as the Jazz Baroness (she was born into the wealthy Rothschild family and later married a French aristocrat) she befriended such giants as Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, Barry Harris, Art Blakey, Miles Davis, Bud Powell, and many more. She inspired over twenty jazz compositions, bailed musicians out of jail, and even acted as a booking agent.<p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>She also collected wishes. Over the course of a decade, Koenigswarter asked three hundred musicians what their three wishes in life were, jotting them all down in a notebook. At the same time she took hundreds of candid photographs, saving them all. In <i>Three Wishes,</i> Koenigswarter&#x2019;s forays into the psyches and lives of these legendary jazz artists are made available in America for the first time.<p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>With a foreword by celebrated jazz critic Gary Giddins, and a introduction from Nica&#x2019;s granddaughter, Nadine de Koenigswarter, providing rare insights into the mysterious baroness&#x2019;s life, this funny, eclectic, and moving compilation is a uniquely intimate look into the immortals of the classic era of jazz, and a must-have for any fan or afficianado.<p></p></p><p>Pannonica de Koenigswarter, daughter of Charles and Rozsika Rothschild, was married to the Baron Jules de Koenigswarter, a renowned freedom fighter in the French resistance, before she moved to New York City, where she emerged as a major patron of the Jazz scene. Nadine de Koenigswarter, Nica&#x2019;s granddaughter, is a multimedia visual artist living in Paris and West Africa. Gary Giddins is an award-winning jazz critic and author. He writes columns about music for <i>Jazz Times</i> and about film for the <i>New York Sun</i>. <br><br><p></p>De Koenigswarter (1913-1988), known as the "Jazz Baroness," was a fixture on the East Coast jazz scene of the 1950s, '60s and '70s. Born into the wealthy Rothschild family and married to a French aristocrat, de Koenigswarter emigrated to New York City in the early '50s and became an enthusiastic patron of artists large and small. She was also a canny amateur photographer, evidenced in this enthralling collection of candid snapshots. She also, over course of a decade, collected wishes from some 300 musicians; alongside vibrant, smoky Polaroids, these wishes--though plenty go to money, health and more wishes--provide a brief glimpse into each subjects' dreams: Julian "Cannonball" Adderley wishes for a jazz artists' subsidy organization; Dinah Washington wishes for triplet girls; and Charles Mingus wishes for "enough to pay my bills, but that's absolutely all." Not everyone wishes deep: Bill Hardman wishes for "a crazy old lady"; David "Fathead" Newman wishes "To get high... right now." Legends like Art Blakey Jr., Miles Davis, Horace Silver and John Coltrane are seen as often at work as at play--de Koenigswarter's New Jersey home, "The Cathouse," was known for housing cats both literal and jazz (Monk spent years there). Free of speculation or commentary, the work has an appropriately improvisational feel, perfect for engaged browsing--if only it came with a CD. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In a concise, easy-to-read format, Dunnigan divulges 150 of the biggest misconceptions about the twentieth century, organizing them under a broad range of such categories as the military, entertainment, technology, and politics.<p>In the same thoughtful but slightly irreverent style that has characterized the Dirty Little Secrets series, Dunnigan explains why nongovernment organizations are actually more powerful than many governments and how the use of droids or combat robots has gone largely unnoticed. He reports the real reason the human life span is so much longer now, and reveals that this century has been as plagued as the Middle Ages by religious wars. And while we might think that wars or epidemics have been the primary cause of death in the twentieth century, Dunnigan reveals that more people have been killed by their own governments than any other means.</p><p>Perfectly timed for the approach of a new millennium, <em>Dirty Little Secrets of the Twentieth Century</em> reveals the shape of the past and direction of our future through the best-kept secrets and surprises of the century.</p></p><p>James F. Dunnigan is the author of many books and over a hundred historical simulations. He has been a lecturer to the State Department, the CIA, and the U.S. Army War College. He lives in New York City.An overview of our late, great century that is consistently fun and informative. Dunnigan is the author of five military history books, other dirty little secret books, and a combination of the two (Dirty Little Secrets of the Vietnam War, 1999, which he co- authored with Albert A. Nofi). The author offers a bird's-eye view of 20th-century changes in areas like population, the economy, health, technology, and lifestyles, and yet can be analytical and conspiratorially revealing on subjects such as marketing, the media, and politics. Rather than simply seeing Americans as a hard-working, well-educated and highly paid people who are unusually mobile, Dunnigan sees the will to move to the jobs as a key to American success. Yes, we've led revolutions in living standards with mass-produced inventions like the safety razor and tampon, but Dunnigan doesn't attribute our superior health and longevity records to antibiotics and hi-tech medical gizmos, but to improved sanitation. Typical of Dunnigan's humor and insights, he writes: ``let us never forget the true medical miracle of the twentieth centurythe sewer pipe.'' The writing is ironic or droll, but the author boldly takes on the high price of police, teachers' unions, and advertising. Dunnigan writes insightfully about Wal-Mart, General Motors, and Atari as well as his familiar subjects like warfare and politics. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Can this massive, brilliant graphic novel-supposedly the first of a nine-volume series-really be its creator&#39;s first published work? Apparently so, and Hines has instantly established himself as a cartoonist to be reckoned with. Duncan is set in a world almost exactly like ours, except that all animals can talk. Humans still have dominion over everything, and a lot of animals aren&#39;t too happy about it; they also see the world in very different ways from each other, and from people. The central plot of this volume is what happens after an animal-rights organization run by a deranged, bloodthirsty macaque detonates a bomb at a human college, but that&#39;s just a springboard for Hines to show off what he can do. Nearly every page has some kind of stunning visual set piece; Hines&#39; range of black-and-white drawing styles incorporate clean-lined &#34;bigfoot&#34; cartooning, hyper-stylized abstract landscapes and near-photorealism, often on the same page. The book is an overwhelming assemblage of stories within stories, stories on top of stories (sometimes literally), and meticulously crafted anecdotes that aren&#39;t directly related to each other but add up to a portrait of a world whose desperate cruelties are more vivid when all its inhabitants can communicate with one another.</p><h2>The Gift</h2><p><i>On a June day, a young woman in a summer dress steps off a Chicago-bound bus into a small midwestern town.

The place is a small midwestern town with a high school and a downtown, a skating pond and a movie house. And on a tree-lined street in the heartland of America, an extraordinary set of events begins to unfold. And gradually what seems serendipitous is tinged with purpose.

She loved the weather, and the trees, brightly lit on everyone's front lawn, and the Santas outlined in lights on the roofs of people's houses. She loved the carols, and waiting for Santa Claus to come, going skating and drinking hot chocolate afterwards, and stringing popcorn with her mother and sitting wide-eyed afterwards looking at how beautiful their Christmas tree was, all lit up. Her mother just let her sit there in the glow of it, her five-year-old face filled with wonder.<br><br> Elizabeth Whittaker was forty-one when Annie was born and she came as a surprise. Elizabeth had long since given up the dream of having another baby. They had tried for years before, Tommy was ten by then, and they had finally made their peace with having only one child. Tommy was a great kid, and Liz and John had always felt lucky. He played football, and baseball with the Little League, and he was the star of the ice hockey team every winter. He was a good boy, and he did everything he was supposed to do, he did well in school, was loving to them, and still there was enough mischief in him to reassure them that he was normal. He was by no means the perfect child, but he was a good boy. He had blond hair like Liz, and sharp blue eyes like his father. He had a good sense of humor and a fine mind, and after the initial shock, he seemed to adjust to the idea of having a baby sister.<br><br> And for the past five and a half years, since she'd been born, he thought the sun rose and set on Annie. She was a wispy little thing with a big grin, and a giggle that rang out in the house every time she and Tommy were together. She waited anxiously for him to come home from school every day, and then they sat eating cookies and drinking milk in the kitchen. Liz had changed to substitute teaching, instead of working full-time after Annie was born. She said she wanted to enjoy every minute of her last baby. And she had. They were together constantly.<br><br> Liz even found time to do volunteer work at the nursery school for two years, and now she helped with the art program at the kindergarten that Annie attended. They baked cookies and bread and biscuits together in the afternoons, or Liz read to her for hours as they sat together in the big cozy kitchen. Their lives were a warm place, where all four of them felt safe from the kinds of things that happened to other people. And John took good care of them. He ran the state's largest wholesale produce business, and he earned a decent living for all of them. He had done well early on, it had been his father and grandfather's business before him. They had a handsome house in the better part of town. They were by no means rich, but they were safe from the cold winds of change that touched farmers and people in businesses that were often adversely affected by trends and fashion. Everyone needed good food, and John Whittaker had always provided it for them. He was a warm, caring man, and he hoped that Tommy would come into the business one day too. But first, he wanted him to go to college. And Annie too, he wanted her to be just as smart and well educated as her mother. Annie wanted to be a teacher, just like her mom, but John dreamed of her being a doctor or a lawyer. For 1952, these were strong dreams, but John had already saved a handsome sum for Annie's education. He'd put Tommy's college money away several years before, so financially they were both well on their way toward college. He was a man who believed in dreams. He always said there was nothing you couldn't do if you wanted it bad enough, and were willing to work hard enough to get it. And he had always been a willing worker. And Liz had always been a great help to him, but he was happy to let her stay home now. He loved coming home in the late afternoons, to find her cuddled up with Annie, or watch the two of them playing dolls in Annie's room. It warmed his heart just to see them. He was forty-nine years old and a happy man. He had a wonderful wife, and two terrific children.<br><br> "Where is everyone?" he called that afternoon as he came in, brushing the snow and ice off his hat and coat, and pushing the dog away, as she wagged her tail and slid around in the puddles he'd made on the floor around him. She was a big Irish setter they had named Bess, after the president's wife. Liz had tried to argue at first that it was a disrespect to Mrs. Truman, but the name seemed to suit her, and it had stuck, and no one seemed to remember how she'd gotten her name now.<br><br> "We're back here," Liz called out, and John walked into the living room to find them hanging gingerbread men on the tree. They had decorated them all afternoon, and Annie had made paper chains while the cookies were in the oven.<br><br> "Hi, Daddy, isn't it beautiful?"<br><br> "It is." He smiled down at her, and then lifted her into his arms with ease. He was a powerful man, with the Irish coloring of his forebears. He had black hair, even now, a year shy of fifty. And brilliant blue eyes, which he had bestowed on both of his children. And in spite of her blond hair, Liz's eyes were a soft brown, sometimes almost hazel. But Annie's hair was almost white it was so fair. And as she smiled into her father's eyes and rubbed her tiny nose playfully against his, she looked like an angel. He set her down gently next to him, and then reached up to kiss his wife, as an affectionate look passed between them.<br><br> "How was your day?" she asked warmly. They had been married for twenty-two years, and most of the time, when life's petty aggravations weren't nibbling at them, they seemed more in love than ever. They had married two years after Liz graduated from college. She'd already been a teacher by then, and it had taken seven years for Tommy to appear. They had almost given up hope and old Dr. Thompson had never really figured out why she either couldn't get, or stay, pregnant. She had had three miscarriages before Tommy was born, and it seemed like a miracle to them when he finally came. And even more so when Annie was born ten years later. They admitted easily that they were blessed, and the children gave them all the joy that they had hoped and expected.<br><br> "I got the oranges in from Florida today," John said as he sat down and picked up his pipe. There was a fire in the fireplace, and the house smelled of gingerbread and popcorn. "I'll bring some home tomorrow."<br><br> "I love oranges!" Annie clapped her hands, and then climbed on his lap, while Bess put both of her paws up on John's knees and tried to join them. John pushed the dog away gently, and Liz came down the ladder to kiss him again and offer him a glass of hot cider.<br><br> "Sounds too good to turn down." He smiled, and then followed her into the kitchen a moment later, silently admiring her trim figure. He was holding Annie's hand, and it was only moments after when the front door slammed, and Tommy came in, with a pink nose and bright red cheeks, carrying his ice skates.<br><br> "Mmm. . . smells good. . . hi, Mom. . . hi, Dad. . . hey, squirt, what did you do today? Eat all of your mom's cookies?" He ruffled her hair and gave her a squeeze, getting her face wet with his own. It was freezing outside, and snowing harder every moment.<br><br> "I <i>made</i> the cookies with Mommy. . . and I only ate four of them," she said meticulously as they laughed. She was so cute she was hard for anyone to resist, least of all her big brother, or her doting parents. But she wasn't spoiled. She was just well loved, and it showed in the ease with which she faced the world and met every challenge. She liked everyone, loved to laugh, loved playing games, loved running in the wind with her hair flying out behind her. She loved to play with Bess. . . but better yet her older brother. She looked up at him adoringly now, taking in the well-worn ice skates. "Can we go skating tomorrow, Tommy?" There was a pond nearby, and he took her there often on Saturday mornings.<br><br> "If it stops snowing by then. If this keeps up, you won't even be able to find the pond," he said, munching on one of his mother's delicious cookies. They were mouthwatering, and they were all Tommy could think of, as his mother carefully took off her apron. She wore a neat blouse and a full gray skirt, and it always pleased John to notice that she still had the figure she'd had when he first met her in high school. She'd been a freshman when he was a senior, and for a long time it had embarrassed him to admit that he was in love with a girl so young, but eventually everyone had figured it out. They teased them at first, but after a while, everyone took them for granted. He'd gone to work for his father the following year, and she had spent another seven years finishing high school and college, and then two more working as a teacher. He had waited a long time for her, but he never doubted for a minute that it was worth it. Everything they had ever really wanted or cared about had come to them slowly, like their children. But all the good things in their lives had been worth the wait. They were happy now. They had everything they had always wanted.<br><br> "I've got a game tomorrow afternoon," Tommy mentioned casually as he gobbled up two more cookies.<br><br> "The day before Christmas Eve?" his mother asked, surprised. "You'd think people would have other things to do." They always went to his games, unless something really major happened to prevent it. John had played ice hockey too, and football. He had loved it too. Liz was a little less sure, she didn't want Tommy to get injured. A couple of the boys had lost teeth in ice hockey games over the years, but Tommy was careful, and pretty lucky. No broken bones, no major injuries, just a lot of sprains and bruises, which his father claimed were all part of the fun.<br><br> "He's a boy for heaven's sake, you can't wr...</p><h2>The Art Doll Chronicles: A Collaborative Journey of Discovery</h2><p>This celebration of nine art dolls and the artists who made them, offers a colorful look at an unusual project that spanned 19 months and took the dolls on a journey all over the United States. Each doll is a one-of-a-kind work of art, made by women who contributed something to each work-in-progress and offered unique perspectives on womanhood and images of dolls. Professional dollmakers as well as a quilt maker, a metalsmith, a woodcarver, and a sculptor created dolls that evolved into vivid characters as they traveled from artist to artist with handmade journals that served as a combination diary, travel log, and artists canvas. From Joe the Wandering &#39;60s Beatnik to a made-over Madeline sure to be kicked out of her French boarding school for her outrageous attire, each doll is accompanied by photographs, excerpts from the journals, and essays by the artists about the joys, challenges, and frustrations of working on the project.</p><p>Catherine Moore is a mixed media artist and veteran of art collaborations. She lives in Peachtree City, Georgia. Deb Evans Braun is a mixed media artist who lives in San Francisco, California. Elizabeth Owen is a quilt artist from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Keely Barham is a mixed media artist who lives in Anaheim, California. Lesley Jacobs is a graphic designer from Seattle, Washington. Lynne Perrella is an illustrator who lives in Ancram, New York. Maria Moya is a mixed media artist from Santa Fe, New Mexico. Rice Freeman Zachery is a mixed media artist who lives in Midland, Texas. Tesha Moore is a publisher of The Studio and resides in Issaquah, Washington.This lavishly illustrated, full-color book starts out with the creation of nine art dolls and their makers. Every detail of the beautiful dolls is shown up close with general commentary on how they were put together. The completed dolls were then sent on a 19-month journey from artist to artist and their travels were recorded in art journals that are also splendidly displayed in the pages of the book. The amount of creativity within both the dolls and the journals is staggering - I can't even put the proper words to it. This is one art book you will never regret buying. --Julie Lovisa, Vine Voice<br><br>Great art doll book. Lots of helpful photos --Karen Rae<br><br>This book has been a great resource for a fun project a group of 50 something friends have started.

The north (Savoy/Piedmont, and Venice ) was ruled by Austria-Hungary, and most of the minor central states were more or less clients of Austria. From Naples, a Spanish-descended Bourbon monarchy ruled the south--'the Two Sicilies.' The European 'Year of Revolutions', 1848, saw popular uprisings against the regimes all over the peninsula. These were eventually crushed (First War of Independence, 1848&#x2013;49); but they left King Victor Emmanuel of Savoy/Piedmont--and his able minister Cavour--determined to liberate and unify the country, while royal authority in the Two Sicilies was left deeply unpopular. </p><p>Savoy/Piedmont endeavored to strengthen the relationship with France and Britain, by sending troops to fight alongside them in the Crimean War, 1854-56 and, as a result, it was actively supported by a French army in the Second War of Independence (1859), when the battles of Magenta and Solferino freed most of the north from Austrian rule. In the south, Garibaldi's 'Redshirts' led a successful rising against the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (1860). Eventually the south voted to join the north in a unified kingdom (February 1861); nevertheless, northern troops had to enforce this by a ruthless occupation during the 1860s--a little-known campaign.</p></p><p><b>Gabriele Esposito</b> is an Italian researcher and a long-time student of military history.

The book focuses on the USS <i>Cushing</i>, whose sixteen missile silos carry more explosive power than all the munitions used in both world wars. The submarine is on a secret mission to the Arctic Ocean to determine whether her missiles are effective when fired from beneath the ice.

When the Germans were blitzing their way across France, Pilot Officer Tom Neil had just received his first posting - to 249 Squadron. Nineteen years old, fresh from training at Montrose on Hawker Audax biplanes he was soon to be pitch forked into the maelstrom of air fighting on which the survival of Britain was to depend.

Yet despite politicians&#39; rhetoric, repeated warnings from the scientific community and countless international conferences, the situation is getting worse. This book brings together articles from leading socialist and environmental activists who argue that the problem is the capitalist system. Whether it is capitalism&#39;s addiction to fossil fuels and plastic or the systematic destruction of the natural world through industrial farming, the system destroys the environment in its endless quest for profits. Mainstream environmental solutions are based on free-market solutions or place hope in business the very causes of the crisis in the first place. In contrast, these articles draw out how capitalism creates environmental destruction and why there needs to be revolutionary transformation of society. Articles include editor Martin Empson on the &#34;future sustainable society&#34; and &#34;agriculture and the environment&#34;, Ian Angus on the Metabolic Rift, Sarah Ensor on &#34;capitalism and biodiversity&#34;, Ian Rappel on the failure of Natural Capital, Suzanne Jeffery on &#34;social movements and climate change&#34;, Amy Leather on fossils fuels and plastic and Camilla Royle on Marxism and the Anthropocene.</p><p></p><h2>A Better Quality of Murder</h2><p><p>Evil lurks on the streets of Victorian London in the third gripping crime novel to feature Scotland Yard Inspector Ben Ross and his wife Lizzie.</p><p>As Inspector Ben Ross of Scotland Yard walks homeward one Saturday night in late October 1867, the fog that swirls around him is like a living beast.

In other words, extremes. The fae like to traffic in absolutes, not this mucky, glorious middle ground.<br><br>San Francisco is a city of hills and valleys, impossible slopes and ridiculous workarounds, with residential streets so narrow that trying to park becomes an eternal game of slow-motion chicken interspersed with wide tourist boulevards designed to present everything in the best possible light. It doesn&#x2019;t help that so much of San Francisco burned down in 1906, allowing city planners to design half of the metro area according to a reasonable, sensible grid system, while the remaining slices of old San Francisco . . . weren&#x2019;t. And still aren&#x2019;t, and never will be, since the odds of the city burning down again are, thankfully, pretty slim.<br><br>This does make San Francisco a challenging place to do my job, since the terrain is frequently working against me. My name is October Daye. I&#x2019;m a knight errant in service to the Court of Shadowed Hills and, by extension, in service to the Kingdom in the Mists. Worse, I&#x2019;m a named and recognized hero of the realm. All this is a fancy way of saying that when fae problems impinge on the mortal world, it&#x2019;s on me to take care of them before they accidentally reveal the existence of Faerie to the mortal world. We&#x2019;ve been in hiding for a long time. &#x201c;A flying hedgehog slammed into my front window&#x201d; is not how we want to be discovered.<br><br>Hence my evening. Quentin, Danny, and I had been running around a residential neighborhood for more than two hours, moving as quietly as we could in an effort not to wake the neighbors. They weren&#x2019;t <i>our</i> neighbors, thankfully. If one of us did make too much noise and wake them up, we could make an excuse about a lost dog or something and run, secure in the knowledge that we&#x2019;d never see them again.<br><br>Humans are good at sleeping through ordinary night noises. Blame it on centuries of diurnal living. They tend to write off things that go bump in the night as overenthusiastic raccoons rummaging in their trash. The noises we were apt to make weren&#x2019;t quite as ordinary, and humans are substantially less inclined to ignore pointy-eared strangers running around outside their kitchen windows. Especially when those strangers are waving butterfly nets over their heads like a bunch of weirdoes.<br><br>To be fair, we <i>are</i> a bunch of weirdoes. It&#x2019;s just that we were a bunch of weirdoes on a mission, and I didn&#x2019;t want that mission to involve yet another run-in with the local police. I think they&#x2019;re getting tired of my face. I know I&#x2019;ve long since gotten tired of theirs. And, really, waking the neighbors was less of a concern than what would happen if we were still outside when the sun came up and burned away all our illusions. That would be when we declared ourselves officially screwed.<br><br>As if we weren&#x2019;t screwed already. Because so much of San Francisco is built on impractically steep hills, many residential streets are connected by narrow alleys which serve as conduits for the stairways lain along the line of the hills. Some of the stairs are stone, some of the stairs are wood; all of the stairs are maintained by the local residents, and that means most of the stairs are death traps. No two steps are the same height, making them a constant tripping hazard, and half the wood stairways have at least one stair that&#x2019;s been rotted through for a decade without anyone getting around to fixing it.<br><br>In case that wasn&#x2019;t bad enough, a damp wind had blown in from the Bay, and <i>all</i> the stairs were slippery. The night had been an adventure, and I was not in an adventurous mood.&nbsp;<br><br>Danny&#x2014;our designated driver for the evening, and one of my staunchest, most indestructible allies&#x2014;propped his butterfly net against his shoulder and frowned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just sayin&#x2019;, maybe you&#x2019;d feel better if you actually learned to open up about your feelings,&#x201d; he said, voice deep and gravelly enough to have come from a concrete mixer instead of from a man.<br><br>The impression wasn&#x2019;t far off. Despite the illusion which made him look like a reasonably nonthreatening human man, Danny is and has always been very far from human. Like most Bridge Trolls, he stands easily seven feet tall, with skin the color and consistency of granite. He&#x2019;s as difficult to injure as your average mountain, which is one of the many things that makes him such desirable backup when I&#x2019;m called upon to do knight errantry in the local cities.<br><br>I heal fast, but it&#x2019;s easier on my wardrobe if I have something&#x2014;or someone&#x2014;I can duck behind to keep myself from being hurt in the first place. That&#x2019;s a very healthy attitude on my part, especially considering how often my friends and allies accuse me of having a self-destructive streak.<br><br>Unfortunately, those same friends and allies seemed to be too busy focusing on my latest set of problems to see how proactive and mature I was being. I glowered at him.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about this right now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t want to talk about it in the car, either.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quentin was in the car.&#x201d;<br><br>Danny scowled down his nose at me. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a kid anymore. You know that better than anybody.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me about it,&#x201d; I grumbled. My squire, Quentin Sollys, had been a dandelion-haired bundle of limbs, manners, and annoying points of etiquette when he&#x2019;d initially forced his way into my life&#x2014;and I do mean <i>forced</i>. I hadn&#x2019;t been looking for a squire. I hadn&#x2019;t been looking for someone to take care of. I certainly hadn&#x2019;t been looking for a teenage boy to eat all my groceries and complain when I was out of ice cream. I&#x2019;d somehow managed to acquire all three of those things in one body, and it had turned out to be surprisingly wonderful and exactly what I&#x2019;d needed.<br><br>Until I&#x2019;d learned he was the Crown Prince of the Westlands, aka, &#x201c;all of North America.&#x201d; That had been less wonderful, since suddenly it wasn&#x2019;t just my squire I was shoving merrily into danger as a learning experience, it was the future of my entire continent. Not that the knowledge had stopped me for long. What&#x2019;s a squire for, if not testing for traps?<br><br>And he&#x2019;d continued growing up the whole time, going from a kid whose biggest romance had been the hand-holding and kissing kind with a human girl from a local high school to full-on dating one of the local Counts. Trying to have the sex talk with my squire was not an experience I wanted to repeat. That meant never taking another squire, and honestly, I was fine with that if it meant sparing myself the squirming indignity.<br><br>&#x201c;So how about you actually <i>talk</i> for a change, and not go looking for excuses?&#x201d;<br><br>I pinched the bridge of my nose. &#x201c;You really think this is the time?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t seeing a better one.&#x201d; Danny shrugged like a landslide. &#x201c;I also ain&#x2019;t seeing any magical flying piggies, so I guess we can take a few minutes to talk about the elephant in the room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are too many nonexistent animals in that sentence, Danny.&#x201d; I dropped my hand. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not looking for pigs, we&#x2019;re looking for hedgehogs. Totally different.&#x201d;<br><br>Specifically, we were hunting for arkan sonney, a fae creature originally found in Avalon. They aren&#x2019;t supposed to exist in the mortal world. They certainly aren&#x2019;t supposed to infest upscale San Francisco neighborhoods. Unfortunately, a changeling named Chelsea Ames lost control of her powers about two years ago, and &#x201c;supposed to&#x201d; no longer reliably applies. Chelsea&#x2019;s father, Etienne, is Tuatha de Dannan, and she inherited his teleporting magic without inheriting his control, or the natural limitations that would have kept her from opening doors Oberon wanted closed.<br><br>Chelsea&#x2019;s lack of limitations might have been okay, had she not come to the attention of a local Duchess with an interest in expansion. Duchess Riordan had decided to use Chelsea to rip open doors to deeper Faerie, which Oberon had sealed for a thrice-damned <i>reason</i>.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t pretty, but in the end, Chelsea survived, Riordan got her just desserts, and we wound up with a minor monster problem. Because, see, open portals go both ways, and Chelsea hadn&#x2019;t exactly been watching to make sure none of the local wildlife followed her through. Being fae creatures, some of our unwanted guests had proven incredibly adept at concealing themselves, and we only found out they were in the mortal world when they popped out and scared the locals.<br><br>Danny snorted. &#x201c;Pigs, hedgehogs, whatever. They have wings, they shouldn&#x2019;t be here, and they&#x2019;re <i>not</i> here, which means we have time to talk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Danny, this isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If he blames you, he needs to stop. And if he won&#x2019;t stop, then maybe you need to think about whether he&#x2019;s good for you. Or whether you&#x2019;re good for him.&#x201d;<br><br>I froze. For a terrible moment, I wasn&#x2019;t looking at Danny, my friend and ally. I was looking at Tybalt, my former enemy, current lover, and best friend, as he stepped into the shadows at the corner of my bedroom and disappeared, leaving me alone. The one thing he&#x2019;d promised I was never going to be again. The scent of pennyroyal and musk hung in the air, taunting me with my inability to follow him.<br><br>I blinked. The moment passed. Danny reappeared, looking concerned, and I hated him, oh, how I hated him. Not for long. More than long enough.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but yeah,&#x201d; said Danny.<br><br>Being a hero of the realm means I&#x2019;m constantly putting myself in the path of danger, like I want nothing more than to have my bones broken and the skin stripped from my body. Being a person means I&#x2019;m never doing it alone. I have friends. I have allies. Not just Quentin and Danny, but others, like my Fetch-turned-sister, May, and her girlfriend, Jazz.<br><br>Like Tybalt, the King of Dreaming Cats. The man who&#x2019;d hated me, helped me, fallen in love with me, and saved my life more times than I cared to count. The man who was supposed to marry me.<br><br>The man who could barely even look at me anymore.<br><br>Who hadn&#x2019;t been able to look at me since my mother, Amandine the Liar, had decided to lock him in a cage and trap him in feline form until she was done with him. Tybalt didn&#x2019;t blame me for my mother&#x2019;s actions&#x2014;I blamed me more than he did&#x2014;but when he looked at me, he saw her, and it was breaking us both.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about this,&#x201d; I said softly.<br><br>&#x201c;I know. But maybe you should.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s for you to decide.&#x201d;<br><br>Danny sighed. &#x201c;Toby, this isn&#x2019;t healthy. You need&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Whatever he thought I needed was cut off by the sound of Quentin&#x2019;s sudden, high-pitched yelp. I whipped around, scanning the shadows until I spotted the outline of my squire, half a block away and struggling to keep hold of his butterfly net. He&#x2019;d managed to snare something the size of a small raccoon, and whatever it was, it looked like it was winning.<br><br>&#x201c;Later,&#x201d; I snapped, casting a quick look back to Danny before I raised my own net and ran toward Quentin, ready to join the fray.<br><br>The trouble with hunting creatures no one has seen in hundreds of years is that when figuring out how to capture or subdue them, we have to rely on the accounts of people who have long since forgotten what the beasts were actually<i> like </i>and have, instead, started remembering them through pleasantly rose-tinted nostalgia. According to the records in the Library of Stars, arkan sonney are sweet, playful creatures, like hedgehogs with wings longer than their bodies, capable of bestowing great fortune on people and places that please them. Supposedly, they&#x2019;re also about as intelligent as the average sheep, and regularly had to be fished out of wells or freed from hunters&#x2019; traps back when they coexisted with the rest of Faerie.<br><br>The thing Quentin had snared in his net bore about as much resemblance to something sweet and innocent and bumbling as I did to a eucalyptus tree. For one thing, it was far too large, and the records hadn&#x2019;t mentioned anything about arkan sonney being chalk white with blazing red eyes and enormous tusks. It looked less like an ordinary hedgehog than it did the result of some unholy hybridization of a porcupine and a wild pig, with the wings of a falcon stapled on for good measure.&nbsp;<br><br>It thrashed. It squealed. It gnashed its terrible teeth at Quentin, who quailed but stood fast, refusing to let go of the net and allow the creature to escape. Brave boy. That was on him, although if I&#x2019;d asked, he would have said it was all because of what he&#x2019;d learned from me. Quentin had always been brave. He&#x2019;d just needed someone to let him show it.<br><br>The sound of my approach caught his attention. He shot me a grateful glance, still struggling to keep hold of the net. Our location meant we couldn&#x2019;t shout the way we normally would have, and Tybalt&#x2019;s absence meant we didn&#x2019;t have a major part of our backup. We&#x2019;d grown shamefully accustomed to having someone who could step through the shadows in the field with us.<br><br>I am nothing if not a skilled improvisor. I glanced frantically around. A trash can rested on a nearby curb, set out for the garbage collectors. Saying a silent apology to the sleeping homeowners, I grabbed it, dumped its contents out, and hoisted it over my head as I ran toward Quentin. Realizing my intent, he let go of the net right before I slammed the trash can down over the shrieking pig-thing.<br><br>Silence reigned. I looked up, meeting Quentin&#x2019;s wide, startled eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s one,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>His shoulders sagged. &#x201c;Her Majesty said there were at least three.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Her name is Arden,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not here. You don&#x2019;t have to use her title.&#x201d;<br><br>Quentin actually smirked at that, although the expression wasn&#x2019;t enough to drive the weariness and worry from his eyes. &#x201c;Can I be there when you tell her that?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Better yet, can I be there when you tell my <i>father</i> that?&#x201d;<br><br>I grimaced. Arden is the daughter of the last legitimate King in the Mists, Gilad Windermere, and as such, has been a princess all her life. The throne was always going to be waiting for her, no matter what else she chose to do . . . or what else was done to her. Thanks to the machinations of Evening Winterrose&#x2014;once my supposed friend and ally, always secretly my enemy, Firstborn daughter of Oberon and Titania, and stone-cold bitch&#x2014;Arden had been in hiding for most of her life and had only recently been able to claim her father&#x2019;s throne. We were all still getting used to the idea that we had a queen who wasn&#x2019;t regularly going to try to have me arrested or banished from the Mists.</p><h2>A.

Craddock, American Mystic, Scholar, Sexologist, Martyr, and Madwoman</h2><p>The nineteenth-century eccentric Ida C. Craddock was by turns a secular freethinker, a religious visionary, a civil-liberties advocate, and a resolute defender of belly-dancing. Arrested and tried repeatedly on obscenity charges, she was deemed a danger to public morality for her candor about sexuality. By the end of her life Craddock, the nemesis of the notorious vice crusader Anthony Comstock, had become a favorite of free-speech defenders and women's rights activists. She soon became as well the case-history darling of one of America's earliest and most determined Freudians.<p>In <i>Heaven's Bride</i>, prize-winning historian Leigh Eric Schmidt offers a rich biography of this forgotten mystic, who occupied the seemingly incongruous roles of yoga priestess, suppressed sexologist, and suspected madwoman. In Schmidt's evocative telling, Craddock's story reveals the beginning of the end of Christian America, a harbinger of spiritual variety and sexual revolution.</p></p><p><b>Leigh Eric Schmidt</b> is Charles Warren Professor of American Religious History at Harvard University, and the author of numerous books, including <i>Restless Souls</i> and <i>Consumer Rites</i>. He lives in Belmont, Massachusetts.<b>Robert Orsi, Professor of Religious Studies and History at Northwestern University</b><br> In this compelling and exciting biography of an extraordinary woman, Leigh Eric Schmidt shows that liberal religion was fundamental to the making of modern American sexuality. Ida C. Craddock battled fiercely and paid dearly for her vision that sexuality and spirituality, pleasure and piety, were intimately connected, both in ancient religions and in contemporary experience. The story Schmidt tells has striking contemporary resonance the struggle for a more open and inclusive sexual ethic has always been a religious one in American culture. This elegantly written, deeply researched book is a great and timely contribution to current public debates and to the history of American sexuality by one of America's leading religious historians.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Stefanie Syman, author of&nbsp;<i>The Subtle Body: The Story of Yoga in America</i></b><br> <i>Heaven's Bride</i> is a lucid and moving account of a woman whose vision of sacred sex and gender equality exposed the fault lines of American liberalism. It's also a poignant reminder that our constitutionally guaranteed division of church and state has needed constant and energetic defense.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</i>(starred review)</b><br> Schmidt illuminates the darkened life of Ida Craddock by aiming a spotlight at each subtitled role.&#x201d;<br><b>Ann Taves, Professor of Religious Studies, University of California at Santa Barbara</b><br> Leigh Schmidt offers us a compulsively readable account of the tragic, fantastic, and utterly idiosyncratic life of Ira Craddock, self-taught scholar, mystic, sex reformer, and psychoanalytic subject.&nbsp; Sympathetic toward Craddock, yet even-handed in his treatment of both her admirers and her vehemently critical detractors, Schmidt opens a window on the fierce ideological cross-currents at the intersection of sexuality, psychology, and religion at the turn of the last century. This is serious scholarship in a form that everyone can enjoy.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Kathi Kern, author of&nbsp;<i>Mrs. Stanton's Bible</i></b><br> With a novelist's grace, Leigh Schmidt tells the absorbing, astonishing, and long-forgotten story of Ida C. Craddock, religious seeker and sex radical. Through Craddock's life, Schmidt restores the spiritual pulse to the sexual revolution of the early twentieth-century. <i>Heaven's Bride</i> is a masterful contribution to the entwined history of religion, sexuality and American reform.&#x201d;<br><br><br><br><b>Richard Fox, Professor of History, University of Southern California, and author of&nbsp;<i>Jesus in America: Personal Savior, Cultural Hero, National Obsession</i></b><br> No other scholar of American culture ranges as widely and deeply across so many thematic frontiers as Leigh Eric Schmidt.&nbsp; In this gripping tale of Ida C. Craddock's edgy frontier crossings he shows his mastery of the borderlands between science and religion, secularity and faith.&nbsp; Readers will blink in wonder at the worldly inventiveness and mystical vision of this long forgotten American original.&#x201d;<br><b>Martin Garbus, First Amendment lawyer and author of&nbsp;<i>The Next Twenty Five Years</i></b><br> In <i>Heaven's Bride</i> Leigh Eric Schmidt has done an admirable job of rescuing the remarkable Ida C. Craddock from the ashes of history and places her before us in her full glory: a brilliant autodidact, a sexual researcher, writer of sex manuals, and wife of an angel named Soph. Craddock is a classic American iconoclast in the spirit of Walt Whitman and her fascinating story is far-reaching, touching on abuses of free speech, early feminism, and America's still-ongoing obsession with sex and purity.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Michael Kazin, author of&nbsp;<i>A Godly Hero: The Life of William Jennings Bryan</i>&nbsp;and professor of history at Georgetown University</b><br> Leigh Eric Schmidt has written not just an enthralling biography of a remarkable woman who both defied and honored Victorian sexual conventions. In delicious prose, he lays bare the search for spiritual fulfillment that gripped millions of Americans in the Gilded Age.&#x201d;<br><b>Jeffrey J. Kripal, J. Newton Rayzor Professor of Religious Studies, Rice University, and author of&nbsp;<i>Authors of the Impossible: The Paranormal and the Sacred</i></b><br> The life and work of Ida C. Craddock show all the signs of a genuine erotic mysticism, as profound as any in the history of religions.&nbsp; Her attempts to express the full measure of this love from secularism and religious liberalism, through psychical research, British occultism, and Indian Tantra, to marriage reform, sexology, and women's rights were as diverse and as passionate as the censorship campaigns, familial condemnations, criminal prosecutions, and mental pathologizing that finally silenced her.&nbsp; Leigh Eric Schmidt, with his trademark erudition, balance, and humor, has effectively resurrected Ida for us from all of this cruelty.&nbsp; She speaks again.&nbsp; This is historical scholarship at its most liberating and most redeeming.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Nancy F. Cott, Trumbull Professor of American History at Harvard University</b><br> The mix of madness and method in Ida Craddock's extraordinary life makes for a rollicking read, amplified by exactingly researched context.&nbsp;Was she a century ahead of her time? You decide.&#x201d;<br><b>Courtney Bender, Associate Professor of Religion at Columbia University</b><br> Schmidt's lyrical, compelling, and captivating story of a truly unique American religious experimenter is a rare gift. In <i>Heaven's Bride</i>, Craddock's sometimes amusing, often tragic interactions with bellydancers, vice informants, the police, asylums, freethinkers, scholars, mystics (and even a disapproving mother and a range of spirit friends) come to life, and provide a window into the unsettledness of American religious life one century ago. Yet Craddock's story is much more than an entertaining and tragic narrative. In Schmidt's story, Craddock's refusal to live within the social boundaries taking shape around her and the consequences that she suffered expose the enormous and often violent efforts that have been required to solidify the distinctions that modern Americans take to be self evident. For all those readers think they know the difference between science and religion, mysticism and sexuality, amateurs and experts, psychosis and devotion, Craddock's life and Schmidt's analysis presents perspicuous challenges. This enormously fascinating book inspires and unsettles, prompting curiosities and hopes and suspicions all in equal measure.' Miss Ida C. Craddock would be pleased.&#x201d;<br><br></p><h2>Kansas Atlas &amp; Gazetteer (Delorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer)</h2><p>Delorme, a Travel Planning Resource.

Jimm Juree, who was well on her way to achieving her goal of becoming the primary crime reporter for the major daily newspaper in Chiang Mai, is less than thrilled to have lost her job as a reporter and to be stuck in the middle of nowhere where little of interest happens. So it is with mixed feelings that she greets the news that a head has washed up on the beach. It's tragic, of course, but this could be the sort of sensational murder that would get her a byline in a major daily and keep her toehold on her journalism career.

He had a lot of problems, did Grandad. Deafness wasn&#x2019;t one of them. Ignorance was. He feigned the former to achieve the latter.<br>&#x201c;Grandad?&#x201d;<br>He knew I was there, but I admit I&#x2019;d chosen a bad time to get through to him. It was the morning rush hour in downtown Maprao and he had traffic to examine. As the fishermen traveled to or from their boats, a lot of them stopped off at Jiep&#x2019;s rice porridge stall across the street. Six thirty was as busy as it would ever get. He sat beside the road in his white undervest and his Fred Flintstone shorts and he <i>tsssked</i> and <i>tutted</i> at the passing vehicles. Like an ex-matador might sit on a farm fence glaring at a bull, pondering how, in his prime he would have demeaned and disfigured the beast, so Grandad gave the evil eye to every passing truck and motorcycle sidecar. There weren&#x2019;t that many, but every one of them flouted the highway code in one way or another. Grandad knew every regulation. He&#x2019;d been a traffic policeman for forty years, and then for fourteen more years he&#x2019;d subscribed to the <i>Royal Thai Police Force Road Users&#x2019; Gazette</i> to keep up with amendments. He was a living compendium of petty legislation: probably the most knowledgeable man on the subject in Chumphon province, if not the whole country. We&#x2019;d often urged him to send in an application to Channel Five&#x2019;s <i>Genuine Fan</i>, where people who&#x2019;d spent their entire lives focused on something utterly useless&#x2014;combative stag beetles, designer handbags, English Premiership football results and the like&#x2014;had a chance to answer questions on their chosen specialty and win a refrigerator. Grandad Jah would have had a fleet of Toshiba freezers by now.<br>I glared at him, still hoping for a response. It was like waiting for Cro-Magnon man to evolve. I wondered what use we might have found for him if he&#x2019;d invested his vast memory on nuclear physics rather than traffic regulations.<br>In rural Thailand it&#x2019;s unlikely anyone would know the first thing about the rules of the road, especially not the police. If you were too poor to front up to the Motor Car License division with a generous bottle of whiskey and a wink (in which case your license would be expedited), you&#x2019;d be asked to fill out a multiple choice quiz whose correct answers were well indented on the pad from the previous twenty applicants. You&#x2019;d then drive your vehicle to a tree, beneath which the examiner sat. He or she would ask you to park. If you managed to do so without knocking over the tree or hitting the examiner, you had a license. The few people who knew the rules were at a disadvantage down here. The north&#x2013;south highway, Route 41, passes through Chumphon, and it&#x2019;s the most dangerous stretch of road in the country. All those righteous smart-alecs from Bangkok who learned when to signal politely and how to adjust their hands at the ten-to-two position on the steering wheel were invariably sideswiped by unlit coconut-carrying pickups coming at them at full speed in the wrong direction. Arrogance is punished in Chumphon.<br>So, anyway, there I was trying to get Grandad&#x2019;s attention for a matter I considered to be infinitely more urgent than traffic.<br>&#x201c;Grandad,&#x201d; I called in an irritating screechy voice. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a head on the beach.&#x201d;<br>If that didn&#x2019;t grab him, nothing would. He&#x2019;d been glaring at a truck with conflicting plates. The one on the back was handwritten on cardboard. The number at the front was different. It was a traffic policeman&#x2019;s nirvana, but I got a dab of eye contact before his attention returned to the truck.<br>&#x201c;A head of what?&#x201d; he asked quietly.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Head of fish?&#x201d;<br>He always spoke slowly and enunciated like a teacher at a special school. Despite the fact that I was a moderately sane thirty-four-year-old Thai woman, he often talked to me as if I was a mentally challenged youth.<br>&#x201c;Head of dog?&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;Head of cabbage?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Head of man,&#x201d; I said, as calmly as I could under the very annoying circumstances. It&#x2019;s always a bother to decide who to tell when you find a head on the beach. I mean, there is no protocol. And when I say &#x201c;always&#x201d; here, I may be exaggerating somewhat because I can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;ve stumbled over too many heads on my morning dog walks. I&#x2019;d seen body parts in morgues, of course, and accident scenes, but that Wednesday was my first detached head. It upset me that it hadn&#x2019;t upset me enough.<br>My inner alarm clock had woken me up at six, as was its habit. It doesn&#x2019;t have an inner snooze button, so I got up. This was not a habit born out of a desire to watch the sunrise or to frolic gaily along the sand with my doggy friends. It was a habit begat by the fact that there was absolutely nothing to do at night in the mulch pit we&#x2019;d arrived in a year earlier. &#x201c;Maprao&#x201d; means coconut, and that pretty much sums the place up: thick skinned, dull as dirt, and containing nothing of substance. I&#x2019;m spending too much time here on sidetracks and making a mess of what should be a tense and exciting opening to my story, so I&#x2019;ll save all the gripes and family intrigues for later.<br>Back to the beach. We had two dogs. Or perhaps I should say the two dogs had us because there were no walls to keep them in. They arrived at mealtimes from whatever mischief they&#x2019;d embroiled themselves in, and would deign to sleep at our modest seaside resort&#x2014;or not. Unfortunately, whenever I opened my cabin door of a morning, there they would be; wagging. Gogo, bitch in every sense of the word, was one of my mother&#x2019;s roadside rescues. No manners. No gratitude. No intestines. She ate like a horse and defecated like a cow. Our vet, Dr. Somboon, who was fortunately a livestock specialist, told us that Gogo was physically unable to digest. So we gave her a mountain of food every day in the expectation that a small hillock of it might find its way to her muscles. That had not yet happened.<br>Dog two: Sticky Rice, white, one enormous black eye, had been a temple pup. He was a thief. Not yet seven months of age, but no excuse. Were he a human teenager, he would be under lock and key at a juvenile correctional facility. No shoe was safe in front of the guest rooms. No bottom-shelf instant noodle pack, no drying squid, no garden vegetable. He had them all. And, cunning beast, he left no evidence because he ate everything: leaves, packets, laces. He gave a new definition to the word &#x201c;consumable.&#x201d; If you&#x2019;ve never seen a dog chew through a breeze block and not spit out the crumbs, you&#x2019;ve not met Sticky.<br>All right. I&#x2019;m lost again. So, there we were, on the beach. The wind <i>du jour</i> was just starting to roll the polystyrene blocks like tumbleweeds. Plastic bags were being thrown up by the tide. There was nothing pleasurable about our amble, but my mother, Mair, insisted I walk the dogs twice a day&#x2014;as if they didn&#x2019;t have legs and minds of their own. It was November, so you could barely make out any sand under all the garbage. Urban dwellers who have a river passing behind their houses see it as a sort of free, convenient, garbage-disposal system. Toss a plastic bag full of diapers into it and <i>voil�</i>, it&#x2019;s gone. Nature is truly a wonder. All that disgusting junk gets spewed out of the Lang Suan River estuary and obligingly sent to our bay via the incoming monsoon tides. The dogs love garbage days because there are obviously so many more nutrients in putrid fish and half-drunk cartons of congealed chocolate milk than there are in the extortionately expensive Pedigree Chum that Mair feeds them.<br>The hounds were forty meters ahead and they&#x2019;d found something among the debris. They were excited. When Gogo comes across something that confuses her, she whimpers and does a sort of canine native-American war dance. When Sticky comes across the unexpected, he eats it. But it was obviously too big to eat because he was doing the forward-backward tango and barking the hell out of it. As I got closer, I thought a rubber mask had been washed up on the tide. A face stared at me with one of those frightening Hallowe&#x2019;en expressions. I decided it would be a lot of fun to take it back to the resort and scare the daylights out of my little brother. I even got close enough to reach down to pick it up. And then I realized.<br>My &#x201c;sister&#x201d; and I have it in mind to one day become wealthy by writing screenplays for movies. A couple of months earlier I&#x2019;d sent off treatments to our hero Clint Eastwood in Carmel, California. He has a movie company called Malpaso Productions. They unequivocally <i>do not </i>accept movie treatments by e-mail. This is to be expected as not only do they not have an e-mail address, they also don&#x2019;t even have a Web site. How much more secure does a man have to be in his own omnipotence than to spurn the Internet? How can you not love such a man? No harassment from annoying amateurs taking up his valuable time. No groupies. Clint is an unapproachable guy unless you happen to have a former brother who&#x2019;s an Internet criminal. Sissi handles the Web like a .44 magnum. Through some basic hacking exercises that I&#x2019;m told any third-grader can do, Sissi found the top-secret e-mail address of Clint&#x2019;s personal assistant, Liced. I&#x2019;ve only ever seen that written down, so I have no idea how you&#x2019;d pronounce it. I&#x2019;m leaning toward Liced as in &#x201c;full of lice.&#x201d; But anyway, Sissi began a line of communication with Liced that initially entailed my sister saying how lucky Liced was to be working with Clint, and Liced telling her to get off her personal e-mail or she&#x2019;d file a harassment suit....</p><h2>The Tangrams Pack</h2><p>This Tangrams Pack contains two tangram sets (one black and one red) and a book with 500 tangram puzzles, including 50 double-set designs.

The eight participants have revised their lectures into chapters on Byzantine history, theology, icons and icon theory, church architecture, monumental painting, silver church furnishings, illustrated liturgical books, and pilgrimage. In addition to presenting current research on this range of topics, the chapters each contribute original scholarship from authors who are recognized experts in their respective fields. </p><p>The Introduction, by Linda Safran, deals with views and definitions of Byzantium over the course of its long history and considers why that civilization deserves our attention today. It underscores the essential unifying role of the Orthodox religion in a vast and fluid empire and clarifies how the experiential aspects of that religion&#x2014;churches, liturgy, church arts and imagery, religious travel&#x2014;open a window into Byzantine culture. Throughout the book, the past is made vivid by considering what Byzantine believers heard and said and did, as well as what they saw. </p><p>The book's chapters are cross-referenced and are complemented both by endnotes that cite primary and secondary sources and by "Suggestions for Further Reading" that include English and foreign-language references. There is no comparable art history text that combines this high-caliber range of current scholarship with more than 250 illustrations, including 16 pages of color plates, to introduce Byzantine culture to a broad readership.</p><p>Contributors are Joseph Alchermes, Susan A. Boyd, Anna Kartsonis, Henry Maguire, Robert Ousterhout, Eric D. Perl, Nancy Patterson &#x160;ev&#x10d;enko, and Gary Vikan.</p></p><p><p>Linda Safran is Associate Professor of Art History in the department of Greek and Latin at The Catholic University of America. She is the author of S<em>an Pietro at Otranto: Byzantine Art in South Italy </em>(1992).</p>&#x201c;This most useful book is the product of a lecture series titled &#x2019;sailing to Byzantium: The Sacred Core of a Great Civilization&#x2019; sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution. . . . Each scholar writes with a clarity sufficient for someone new to the subject while raising issues at a level of sophistication and with a range of bibliography (and a useful glossary) that provoke further study for the more engaged reader. Consistent use of primary sources provides a vivid context for the concepts surrounding the works discussed. . . . The particular virtue of this book is the singular priority given to the church and its art as an expression of the Orthodox liturgy conducted within the sanctuary space, the essence of what unifies a vast and important part of the world even after the political apogee of the empire itself.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Elizabeth C.

What he discovered was startling: The vastly disproportionate cultivation of all-male plant varieties produces large amounts of intensely irritating airborne pollen. This extensively researched, comprehensive, plant-by-plant reference alerts gardeners and helps them make landscaping choices that can drastically reduce their exposure to harmful allergens. Complete with alphabetical entries of basic planting information, growing zones, and allergy ratings.</p><p>THOMAS L. OGREN is a former landscape gardening instructor, nursery owner, gardening radio show host, and author, with an M.S. in agricultural science. He currently resides in San Luis Obispo, CA.This book presents a new idea and does so very well indeed. Ogren, a former landscape gardening instructor, proposes that in our private and public landscaping we need to reduce the use of plants that cause allergies. Until the publication of this book, the information needed to make allergy-free choices had not been compiled in one easily accessible source; nor had a scale been devised for rating plants that cause allergies. Here, Ogren accomplishes both these aims. His introductory material presents many plants and allergies new to this reviewer, and he shows how to apply his ideas. The main part of the book consists of plants listed in alphabetical order by their scientific names, with numerous cross references to their common names. Brief annotations provide descriptions and notes regarding allergies. The most important feature, however, is the rating of plants on a scale from one to ten (with ten causing the worst allergic reactions). As David Stadtner, a practicing allergist, writes in his foreword, "the book should be in the library of every nursery and municipal park department." It should be in public and academic libraries as well.<br><i>-Carol Cubberley, Univ. of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Children&#39;s Bible - Nrsv</h2><p><p>This beautifully illustrated Children's Bible features eye-catching artwork and study helps that will delight young readers ages 6 to 12.</p></p><p></p><h2>Death by &#34;Gun Control&#34;: The Human Cost of Victim Disarmament</h2><p>The Human Cost of Victim Disarmament Details how anti-gun laws undermine the sanctity of human life, how gun control laws violate self-rights</p><p></p><h2>Augustine of Hippo: Selected Writings (HarperCollins Spiritual Classics)</h2><p><p>Augustine of Hippo (354-430) is one of the most influential figures in the history of the Church.

In the end, you can boil everything down to something similar&#x2014;or so Roberta Anderson thought much later on. It&#x2019;s either all an accident&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or all fate. Anderson literally stumbled over her destiny in the small town of Haven, Maine, on June 21, 1988. That stumble was the root of the matter; all the rest was nothing but history.<br> 2<p></p> <br>Anderson was out that afternoon with Peter, an aging beagle who was now blind in one eye. Peter had been given to her by Jim Gardener in 1976. Anderson had left college the year before with her degree only two months away to move onto her uncle&#x2019;s place in Haven. She hadn&#x2019;t realized how lonely she&#x2019;d been until Gard brought the dog. He&#x2019;d been a pup then, and Anderson sometimes found it difficult to believe he was now old&#x2014;eighty-four in dog&#x2019;s years. It was a way of measuring her own age. Nineteen-seventy-six had receded. Yes indeed. When you were twenty-five, you could still indulge in the luxury of believing that, in your case, at least, growing up was a clerical error which would eventually be rectified. When you woke up one day and discovered your dog was eighty-four and you yourself were thirty-seven, that was a view that had to be reexamined. Yes indeed.<br> <br>Anderson was looking for a place to cut some wood. She&#x2019;d a cord and a half laid by, but wanted at least another three to take her through the winter. She had cut a lot since those early days when Peter had been a pup sharpening his teeth on an old slipper (and wetting all too often on the dining-room rug), but the place was still not short. The property (still, after thirteen years, mostly referred to by the townspeople as the old Garrick place) had only a hundred and eighty feet on Route 9, but the rock walls marking the north and south boundaries marched off at diverging angles. Another rock wall&#x2014;this one so old it had degenerated into isolated rock middens furred with moss&#x2014;marked the property&#x2019;s rear boundary about three miles into an unruly forest of first-and second-growth trees. The total acreage of this pie-shaped wedge was huge. Beyond the wall at the western edge of Bobbi Anderson&#x2019;s land were miles of wilderness owned by the New England Paper Company. Burning Woods, on the map.<br> <br>In truth, Anderson didn&#x2019;t really need to hunt a place to do her cutting. The land her mother&#x2019;s brother had left her was valuable because most of the trees on it were good hardwood relatively untouched by the gypsy-moth infestation. But this day was lovely and warm after a rainy spring, the garden was in the ground (where most of it would rot, thanks to the rains), and it wasn&#x2019;t yet time to start the new book. So she had covered the typewriter and here she was with faithful old one-eyed Peter, rambling.<br> <br>There was an old logging road behind the farm, and she followed this almost a mile before striking off to the left. She was wearing a pack (a sandwich and a book in it for her, dog biscuits for Peter, and lots of orange ribbon to tie around the trunks of the trees she would want to cut as September&#x2019;s heat ebbed toward October) and a canteen. She had a Silva compass in her pocket. She had gotten lost on the property only once, and once was enough to last her forever. She had spent a terrible night in the woods, simultaneously unable to believe she had actually gotten lost on property she for Christ&#x2019;s sweet sake owned and sure she would die out here&#x2014;a possibility in those days, because only Jim would know she was missing, and Jim only came when you weren&#x2019;t expecting him. In the morning, Peter had led her to a stream, and the stream had led her back to Route 9, where it burbled cheerfully through a culvert under the tar only two miles from home. Nowadays she probably had enough woods savvy to find her way back to the road or to one of the rock walls bounding her land, but the key word was probably. So she carried a compass.<br> <br>She found a good stand of maple around three o&#x2019;clock. In fact, she had found several other good stands of wood, but this one was close to a path she knew, a path wide enough to accommodate the Tomcat. Come September 20th or so&#x2014;if someone didn&#x2019;t blow the world up in the meantime&#x2014;she would hook her sledge up to the Tomcat, drive in here, and do some cutting. Besides, she had walked enough for one day.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look good, Pete?&#x201d;<br> <br>Pete barked feebly, and Anderson looked at the beagle with a sadness so deep it surprised and disquieted her. Peter was done up. He seldom took after birds and squirrels and chipmunks and the occasional woodchuck these days; the thought of Peter running a deer was laughable. She would have to take a good many rest stops on the way back for him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there had been a time, not that long ago (or so her mind stubbornly maintained), when Peter would always have been a quarter of a mile ahead of her, belling volleys of barks back through the woods. She thought there might come a day when she would decide enough was enough; she&#x2019;d pat the seat on the passenger side of the Chevrolet pickup for the last time, and take Peter to the vet down in Augusta. But not this summer, please God. Or this fall or winter, please God. Or ever, please God.<br> <br>Because without Peter, she would be alone. Except for Jim, and Jim Gardener had gotten more than just a trifle wiggy over the last eight years or so. Still a friend, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wiggy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Glad you approve, Pete old man,&#x201d; she said, putting a ribbon or two around the trees, knowing perfectly well she might decide to cut another stand and the ribbons would rot here. &#x201c;Your taste is only exceeded by your good looks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter, knowing what was expected of him (he was old, but not stupid), wagged his scraggy stub of a tail and barked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Be a Viet Cong!&#x201d; Anderson ordered.<br> <br>Peter obediently fell on his side&#x2014;a little wheeze escaped him&#x2014;and rolled on his back, legs splayed out. That almost always amused Anderson, but today the sight of her dog playing Viet Cong (Peter would also play dead at the words &#x201c;hooch&#x201d; or &#x201c;My Lai&#x201d;) was too close to what she had been thinking about.<br> <br>&#x201c;Up, Pete.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pete got up slowly, panting below his muzzle. His white muzzle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go back.&#x201d; She tossed him a dog biscuit. Peter snapped at it and missed. He snuffed for it, missed it, then came back to it. He ate it slowly, without much relish. &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Anderson said. &#x201c;Move out.&#x201d;<br> 3<p></p> <br>For want of a shoe, the kingdom was lost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the choice of a path, the ship was found.<br> <br>Anderson had been down here before in the thirteen years that the Garrick place hadn&#x2019;t become the Anderson place; she recognized the slope of land, a deadfall left by pulpers who had probably all died before the Korean War, a great pine with a split top. She had walked this land before and would have no trouble finding her way back to the path she would use with the Tomcat. She might have passed the spot where she stumbled once or twice or half a dozen times before, perhaps by yards, or feet, or bare inches.<br> <br>This time she followed Peter as the dog moved slightly to the left, and with the path in sight, one of her elderly hiking boots fetched up against something&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fetched up hard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; she yelled, but it was too late, in spite of her pinwheeling arms. She fell to the ground. The branch of a low bush scratched her cheek hard enough to bring blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; she cried, and a bluejay scolded her.<br> <br>Peter returned, first sniffing and then licking her nose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Christ, don&#x2019;t do that, your breath stinks!&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter wagged his tail. Anderson sat up. She rubbed her left cheek and saw blood on her palm and fingers. She grunted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice going,&#x201d; she said, and looked to see what she had tripped over&#x2014;a fallen piece of tree, most likely, or a rock poking out of the ground. Lots of rock in Maine.<br> <br>What she saw was a gleam of metal.<br> <br>She touched it, running her finger along it and then blowing off black forest dirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; she asked Peter.<br> <br>Peter approached, sniffed at it, and then did a peculiar thing. The beagle backed off two dog-paces, sat down, and uttered a single low howl.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who got on your case?&#x201d; Anderson asked, but Peter only sat there. Anderson hooked herself closer, still sitting down, sliding on the seat of her jeans. She examined the metal in the ground.<br> <br>Roughly three inches stuck out of the mulchy earth&#x2014;just enough to trip over. There was a slight rise here, and perhaps the runoff from the heavy spring rains had freed it. Anderson&#x2019;s first thought was that the skidders who had logged this land in the twenties and thirties must have buried a bunch of their leavings here&#x2014;the cast-off swill of a three-day cutting, which in those days had been called a &#x201c;loggers&#x2019; weekend.&#x201d;<br> <br>A tin can, she thought&#x2014;B&amp;M beans or Campbell&#x2019;s soup. She wiggled it the way you&#x2019;d wiggle a tin can out of the earth. Then it occurred to her that no one except a toddler would be apt to trip over the leading edge of a can. The metal in the earth didn&#x2019;t wiggle. It was as solid as mother-rock. A piece of old logging equipment, maybe?<br> <br>Intrigued, Anderson examined it more closely, not seeing that Peter had gotten to his feet, backed away another four paces, and sat down again.<br> <br>The metal was a dull gray&#x2014;not the bright color of tin or iron at all. And it was thicker than a can, maybe a quarter-inch at its top. Anderson placed the pad of her right index finger on this edge and felt a momentary odd tingling, like a vibration.<br> <br>She took her finger away and looked at it quizzically.<br> <br>Put it back.<br> <br>Nothing. No buzz.<br> <br>Now she pinched it between her thumb and finger and tried to draw it from the earth like a loose tooth from a gum. It didn&#x2019;t come. She was gripping the protrusion in the rough center. It sank back into the earth&#x2014;or that was the impression she had then&#x2014;on either side at a width of less than two inches. She would later tell Jim Gardener that she could have walked past it three times a day for forty years and never stumbled over it.<br> <br>She brushed away loose soil, exposing a little more of it. She dug a channel along it about two inches deep with her fingers&#x2014;the soil gave easily enough, as forest soil does&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at least until you hit the webwork of roots. It continued smoothly down into the ground. Anderson got up on her knees and dug down along either side. She tried wiggling it again. Still no go.<br> <br>She scraped away more soil with her fingers and quickly exposed more&#x2014;now she saw six inches of gray metal, now nine, now a foot.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a car or a truck or a skidder, she thought suddenly. Buried out here in the middle of nowhere. Or maybe a Hooverville kind of stove. But why here?<br> <br>No reason that she could think of; no reason at all. She found things in the woods from time to time&#x2014;shell casings, beer cans (the oldest not with pop-tops but with triangleshaped holes made by what they had called a &#x201c;churchkey&#x201d; back in those dim dead days of the 1960s), candy wrappers, other stuff. Haven was not on either of Maine&#x2019;s two major tourist tracks, one of which runs through the lake and mountain region to the extreme west of the state and the other of which runs up the coast to the extreme east, but it had not been the forest primeval for a long, long time. Once (she had been over the decayed stone wall at the back of her land and actually trespassing on New England Paper Company&#x2019;s land at the time) she had found the rusted hulk of a late-forties Hudson Hornet standing in what had once been a woods road and what was now, over twenty years after the cutting had stopped, a tangle of second growth&#x2014;what the locals called shit-wood. No reason that hulk of a car should have been there, either&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it was easier to explain than a stove or a refrigerator or any other damn thing actually buried in the ground.<br> <br>She had dug twin trenches a foot long on either side of the object without finding its end. She got down almost a foot before scraping her fingers on rock. She might have been able to pull the rock out&#x2014;that at least had some wiggle&#x2014;but there was no reason to do it. The object in the earth continued down past it.<br> <br>Peter whined.<br> <br>Anderson glanced at the dog, then stood up. Both knees popped. Her left foot tingled with pins and needles. She fished her pocket watch out of her pants&#x2014;old and tarnished, the Simon watch was another part of her legacy from Uncle Frank&#x2014;and was astonished to see that she had been here a long time: an hour and a quarter at least. It was past four.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Pete,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s bug out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Peter whined again but still wouldn&#x2019;t move. And now, with real concern, Anderson saw that her old beagle was shivering all over, as if with ague. She had no idea if dogs could catch ague, but thought old ones might. She did recollect that the only time she had ever seen Peter shiver like that was in the fall of 1977 (or maybe it had been &#x2019;78). There had been a catamount on the place. Over a series of perhaps nine nights it had screamed and squalled, very likely in unrequited heat. Each night Peter would go to the living-room window and jump up on the old church pew Anderson kept there by her bookcase. He never barked. He only looked out into the dark toward that unearthly, womanish squealing, nostrils flaring, ears up. And he shivered.<br> <br>Anderson stepped over her little excavation and went to Peter. She knelt down and ran her hands along the sides of Peter&#x2019;s face, feeling the shiver in her palms.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong, boy?&#x201d; she murmured, but she knew what was wrong. Peter&#x2019;s good eye shifted past her, toward the thing in the earth, and then back to Anderson. The plea in the eye not veiled by the hateful, milky cataract was as clear as speech: Let&#x2019;s get out of here, Bobbi, I like that thing almost as much as I like your sister.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Anderson said uneasily. It suddenly occurred to her that she could not remember ever having lost track of time as she had today, out here.<br> <br>Peter doesn&#x2019;t like it. I don&#x2019;t either.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on.&#x201d; She started up the slope to the path. Peter followed with alacrity.<br> <br>They were almost to the path when Anderson, like Lot&#x2019;s wife, looked back. If not for that last glance, she might actually have let the whole thing go. Since leaving college before finals&#x2014;in spite of her mother&#x2019;s tearful pleas and her sister&#x2019;s furious diatribes and baleful ultimatums&#x2014;Anderson had gotten good at letting things go.<br> <br>The look back from this middle distance showed her two things. First, the thing did not sink back into the earth as she had at first thought. The tongue of metal was sticking up in the middle of a fairly fresh declivity, not wide but fairly deep, and surely the result of late-winter runoff and the heavy spring rains that had followed it. So the ground to either side of the protruding metal was higher, and the metal simply disappeared back into it. Her first impression, that the thing in the ground was the corner of something, wasn&#x2019;t true after all&#x2014;or not necessarily true. Second, it looked like a plate&#x2014;not a plate you&#x2019;d eat from, but a dull metal plate...</p><h2>The Water Babies (Wonder Colour Series)</h2><p>Light blue glossy hardcover with a water baby sitting on a lily pad reaching for a dragon fly.

The Metaphysical Club was an informal group that met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1872, to talk about ideas. Its members included Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., founder of modern jurisprudence; William James, the father of modern American psychology; and Charles Sanders Peirce, logician, scientist, and the founder of semiotics. The Club was probably in existence for about nine months. No records were kept. The one thing we know that came out of it was an idea -- an idea about ideas. This book is the story of that idea. Holmes, James, and Peirce all believed that ideas are not things &#34;out there&#34; waiting to be discovered but are tools people invent -- like knives and forks and microchips -- to make their way in the world. They thought that ideas are produced not by individuals, but by groups of individuals -- that ideas are social. They do not develop according to some inner logic of their own but are entirely dependent -- like germs -- on their human carriers and environment. And they thought that the survival of any idea depends not on its immutability but on its adaptability. &#39;The Metaphysical Club&#39; is written in the spirit of this idea about ideas. It is not a history of philosophy but an absorbing narrative about personalities and social history, a story about America. It begins with the American Civil War and ends with World War I. This is a book about the evolution of the American mind during the crucial period that formed the world we now inhabit.</p><p>If past is prologue, then <i>The Metaphysical Club</i> by Louis Menand may suggest an intellectual course for the United States in the 21st century. At least Menand, a frequent contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i> and <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, thinks so. This enthralling study of Oliver Wendell Holmes, William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, and John Dewey shows how these four men developed a philosophy of pragmatism following the Civil War, a period Menand likens to post-cold-war times. Together, "they were more responsible than any other group for moving American thought into the modern world." <p> Despite this potentially forbidding theme, <i>The Metaphysical Club</i> is not a dry tome for academics. Instead, it is a quadruple biography, a wonderfully told story of ideas that advances by turning these thinkers into characters and bringing them to life. Menand links them through the Metaphysical Club, a conversational club formed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1872. It lasted but a few months, and references to it appear only in Peirce's writings (its real significance seems rather limited), though Holmes and James were both members. (Dewey was much younger than these three, and more an heir than a contemporary.) It is difficult to describe in a sentence or two what they accomplished, though Menand takes a stab at it: "They helped put an end to the idea that the universe is an idea, that beyond the mundane business of making our way as best we can in a world shot through with contingency, there exists some order, invisible to us, whose logic we transgress at our peril." Academic freedom and cultural pluralism are just two of their legacies, and they are linchpins of democracy in a nonideological age, says Menand. </p><p> A book like this is necessarily idiosyncratic, yet at the same time this one is sweeping. It presents an accessible survey of intellectual life from roughly the end of the Civil War to the start of the cold war. Dozens of figures receive fascinating thumbnail sketches, from Ralph Waldo Emerson and Charles Darwin to Jane Addams and Eugene Debs. The result is a grand portrait of an age that will appeal to anyone with even a modest interest in the history of philosophy and ideas. <i>--John Miller</i></p>Louis Menand is a professor of English at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, a staff writer at The New Yorker, and has been a contributing editor of The New York Review of Books since 1994.</p><h2>Pocket Books : Reptiles</h2><p>Series: Pocket Books Ages:6 years and up Size of book:4 5/8 x 6 1/4 inches Pages: 128, paperback This Pocket-sized guide explores the amazing natural world of Reptiles.

Who would have guessed that there are more than 40 species of ravens and crows, all variations on a theme, cawing and croaking their way through the woodlands of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and various South Sea islands? (Of the temperate continents, only South America doesn&#x2019;t know the charms of these amusing, intelligent birds.) Topics explored include evolution, distribution, diet and food-getting practices (including their ingenious use of tools), social behavior (including the many crow languages&#x201d;), and impact on the human imagination, as reflected in mythology, literature, and popular aphorisms. Appealing to both the avid birder or the more casual nature lover, <i>Crows</i> is rich in insight, humor, and stories.</p><p>In this charming introduction to the genus Corvus, Savage consolidates scientific research with myths and legends, to attest to the cleverness of crows, ravens, rooks and jackdaws. Savage begins with reports of tool-use by crows in New Guinea; they not only use bits of twig to dig insects out of narrow holes, but they also shape the twigs to form hooks that grab insects and prevent them from escaping. As legends show, humans have been fascinated by crows for thousands of years, and the raven plays a prominent role in many aboriginal creation myths. Synthesizing science and storytelling, Savage shows that the ancient image of crow-as-trickster bears out among contemporary researchers, who have observed such crow behavior as misrepresentation and misdirection. In addition, some species of crow show evidence of language skills and even artistic sensibility (as in the case of a winged shell collector). They also exhibit cooperative child-rearing, as well as grieving behavior after losing a mate or chick. Though this illuminating book ends too quickly, readers wishing to follow up on the clever Corvus will be quite pleased with Savage's detailed footnotes and lengthy list of references. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With two gold and two silver medals at both the Olympic Games and the World Championships, and with five gold, four silver and two bronze medals at European Championships, Harry Boldt was one of the greatest competitive dressage riders in the world for over two decades. Only very few riders have a comparable wealth of experience in both producing dressage horses and riding internationally. Harry Boldt passes on this experience in his book The Dressage Horse. Not only does he describe how the ideal training of a dressage horse up to the highest levels should progress, but he also, and more importantly, demonstrates which different training methods he himself has used, which methods suit which horses best, and how one can successfully re-school incorrectly-trained dressage horses. It is a practical book for the discerning rider, authored by a man who writes in the same way as he talks: simply and understandably. This is what sets his book apart from those by many other riding theo-rists . The text is complemented by a unique abundance of photographic and illustrative teaching material. The combination of photographs, illustrations and precise textual explanations is the most efficient method for conveying expert riding knowledge. On his Olympic and World Championship-winning horse Woyceck, the author demonstrates dressage movements to perfection. Rarely can one find, for example, pictures of such harmonious transitions between piaffe and passage or such straight and uphill flying changes as in this book. Photographic sequences with slow-motion pictures at the rate of nine shots per second break the dressage movements down into individual components that the human eye could not otherwise per-ceive. Next to these, numerous photomontages clearly demonstrate the movement processes in a single picture. A further teaching aid is provided by the diagrams accompanying each dressage movement. They explain precisely and chronologically the correct interaction of weight, leg and rein aids. The large didactic part of this book is complemented by an extensive documentation of the historical development of dressage riding and a report on the 1978 World Championships in Goodwood. These World Championships were the last major international outing of Harry Boldt as a dressage rider. Harry Boldt was assisted in the production of his book by the famous dressage riders Dr Reiner Klimke, Herbert Kuckluck, Dr h.c. Josef Neckermann, Herbert Rehbein, Dr Uwe Schulten-Baumer, Willi Schultheis, Gabriela Grillo and Maria G�nther. They all portrayed many of the most famous German dressage horses of post-war times. For the new 2011 edition, many more top dressage horses have been added. Their riders Klaus Balkenhol, Nadine Capellmann, Edward Gal, Anky van Grunsven, Anne Grethe Jensen, Margit Otto-Crepin, Ulla Salzgeber, Monica Theodorescu, Nicole Uphoff and Isabell Werth have remained faithful to the book s original style and described the temperament and charac-ter of the brightest stars of today s dressage, elucidating their strengths and weaknesses, quirks, diffi-culties in training, conformational and movement features, in addition to other interesting anecdotes. Willi Schultheis, who was the Germany national team coach at the time the first edition of this book was published, provided his private photo collection, contributed to the historic part of the book and commented on Boldt s final rides at the World Championships in Goodwood in 1978. This revised edition of The Dressage Horse by Harry Boldt is a modern, comprehensive textbook on dressage riding, and is a treasure trove even for those already knowledgeable about this magnificent sport.</p><p>Harry Boldt is one of the most successful dressage riders and trainers in the world. Born in the East Prussian town of Insterburg in 1930, Harry Boldt developed his love for equestrianism through his father, the renowned and highly successful trainer Heinrich Boldt, practically from when he was still in the cradle. Harry Boldt started his career in showjumping, where he rode successfully up to advanced level. Only later did he start to concentrate solely on dressage. At the start of the 1960s, he made his international breakthrough in this discipline and, up to 1979, he won a total of three titles at the German Dressage Championships. He secured seven individual and eight team medals at European and World Championships. At the Olympic Games in Tokyo, he picked up team gold and individual silver with his Westphalian gelding Remus. Twelve years later, at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, he once again won team gold and individual silver, partnering his Hanoverian gelding Woyceck. At the age of 50, Harry Boldt ended his own riding career and dedicated himself solely to the training of horses and riders. Between 1981 and 1996, he held the position of Team Trainer of the German National Dressage team. During his mandate as national team trainer, German dressage riders won the tremendous sum of 50 medals at European Championships, World Championships and Olympic Games; 31 of them were gold. Harry Boldt could therefore count himself amongst the most successful national team trainers in any sport. Boldt, who got to know legendary trainers such as Felix B�rkner, Richard W�tjen and Otto L�rke personally, was honoured for his extraordinary services to dressage by the German Equestrian Federation (FN) with the honorary title of Riding Master. In 1995, the FN bestowed him with the German Riding Cross in gold. Following the conclusion of his mandate as national team trainer for dressage, Harry Boldt emigrated to Australia. Harry Boldt remains in demand internationally as a coach and trainer.</p><h2>The Illuminated Language of Flowers</h2><p>&#34;Presents one of the most enchanting customs of the early 19th century - communicating through flowers instead of words.

His early years were spent in Lancashire and Hampshire. He left school at sixteen to work as a local government clerk until being called up for army service in 1941, and spent the following four and a half years with the Royal Corps of Signals, in Gibraltar, North Africa, Italy, and Austria. </p><p> On leaving the army he renewed a teenage ambition toward being a writer, and in 1947, on the basis of an unfinished novel, won an Atlantic Award, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, which enabled him to devote himself to writing for a year. He tried to justify the award by writing serious novels, but subsequently also wrote detective thrillers, light comedies, novels based on cricket, and science fiction, to which he had been passionately devoted in his early teens. After several adult science fiction novels, he was asked to write for the young adult field, and ended up writing sixteen books in that genre, including <i>The Guardians, The Lotus Caves, Dom and Va, Empty World,</i> and the Sword and Fireball trilogies, as well as the Tripods trilogy. Following a BBC television series in 1984 based on the Tripods books, he wrote a prequel, <i>When the Tripods Came,</i> explaining how it all came about. </p><p> Sam Youd is a widower with five children and numerous grandchildren, and lives in Rye, in the county of Sussex, England.</p><p><br> Chapter One: Capping Day </p><p><br> Apart from the one in the church tower, there were five clocks in the village that kept reasonable time, and my father owned one of them. It stood on the mantelpiece in the parlor, and every night before he went to bed he took the key from a vase, and wound it up. Once a year the clockman came from Winchester, on an old jogging packhorse, to clean and oil it and put it right. Afterward he would drink camomile tea with my mother, and tell her the news of the city and what he had learned in the villages through which he had passed. My father, if he were not busy milling, would stalk out at this time, with some contemptuous remark about gossip; but later, in the evening, I would hear my mother passing the stories on to him. He did not show much enthusiasm, but he listened to them. </p><p> My father's great treasure, though, was not the clock, but the Watch. This, a miniature clock with a dial less than an inch across and a circlet permitting it to be worn on the wrist, was kept in a locked drawer of his desk; and only brought out to be worn on ceremonial occasions, like Harvest Festival, or a Capping. The clockman was only allowed to see to it every third year, and at such times my father stood by, watching him as he worked. There was no other Watch in the village, nor in any of the villages round about. The clockman said there were a number in Winchester, but none as fine as this. I wondered if he said it to please my father, who certainly showed pleasure in the hearing, but I believe it truly was of very good workmanship. The body of the Watch was of a steel much superior to anything they could make at the forge in Alton, and the works inside were a wonder of intricacy and skill. On the front was printed "Anti-magnetique Incabloc," which we supposed must have been the name of the craftsman who made it in olden times. </p><p> The clockman had visited us the week before, and I had been permitted to look on for a time while he cleaned and oiled the Watch. The sight fascinated me, and after he had gone I found my thoughts running continually on this treasure, now locked away again in its drawer. I was, of course, forbidden to touch my father's desk and the notion of opening a locked drawer in it should have been unthinkable. Nonetheless, the idea persisted. And after a day or two, I admitted to myself that it was only the fear of being caught that prevented me. </p><p> On Saturday morning, I found myself alone in the house. My father was in the mill room, grinding, and the servants -- even Molly who normally did not leave the house during the day -- had been brought in to help. My mother was out visiting old Mrs. Ash, who was sick, and would be gone an hour at least. I had finished my homework, and there was nothing to stop my going out into the bright May morning and finding Jack. But what completely filled my mind was the thought that I had this opportunity to look at the Watch, with small chance of detection. </p><p> The key, I had observed, was kept with the other keys in a small box beside my father's bed. There were four, and the third one opened the drawer. I took out the Watch, and gazed at it. It was not going, but I knew one wound it and set the hands by means of the small knob at one side. If I were to wind it only a couple of turns it would run down quite soon -- just in case my father decided to look at it later in the day. I did this, and listened to its quiet rhythmic ticking. Then I set the hands by the clock. After that it only remained for me to slip it on my wrist. Even notched to the first hole, the leather strap was loose; but I was wearing the Watch. </p><p> Having achieved what I had thought was an ultimate ambition, I found, as I think is often the case, that there remained something more. To wear it was a triumph, but to be seen wearing it...I had told my cousin, Jack Leeper, that I would meet him that morning, in the old ruins at the end of the village. Jack, who was nearly a year older than myself and due to be presented at the next Capping, was the person, next to my parents, that I most admired. To take the Watch out of the house was to add enormity to disobedience, but having already gone so far, it was easier to contemplate it. My mind made up, I was determined to waste none of the precious time I had. I opened the front door, stuck the hand with the Watch deep into my trouser pocket, and ran off down the street. </p><p> The village lay at a crossroads, with the road in which our house stood running alongside the river (this giving power for the mill, of course) and the second road crossing it at the ford. Beside the ford stood a small wooden bridge for foot travelers, and I pelted across, noticing that the river was higher than usual from the spring rains. My Aunt Lucy was approaching the bridge as I left it at the far end. She called a greeting to me, and I called back, having first taken care to veer to the other side of the road. The baker's shop was there, with trays of buns and cakes set out, and it was reasonable that I should be heading that way: I had a couple of pennies in my pocket. But I ran on past it, and did not slacken to a walk until I had reached the point where the houses thinned out and at last ended. </p><p> The ruins were a hundred yards farther on. On one side of the road lay Spiller's meadow, with cows grazing, but on my side there was a thorn hedge, and a potato field beyond. I passed a gap in the hedge, not looking in my concentration on what I was going to show Jack, and was startled a moment later by a shout from behind me. I recognized the voice as Henry Parker's. </p><p> Henry, like Jack, was a cousin of mine -- my name is Will Parker -- but, unlike Jack, no friend. (I had several cousins in the village: people did not usually travel far to marry.) He was a month younger than I, but taller and heavier, and we had hated each other as long as I could remember. When it came to fighting, as it very often did, I was outmatched physically, and had to rely on agility and quickness if I were not going to be beaten. From Jack I had learned some skill in wrestling which, in the past year, had enabled me to hold my own more, and in our last encounter I had thrown him heavily enough to wind him and leave him gasping for breath. But for wrestling one needed the use of both hands. I thrust my left hand deeper into the pocket and, not answering his call, ran on toward the ruins. </p><p> He was closer than I had thought, though, and he pounded after me, yelling threats. I put a spurt on, looked back to see how much of a lead I had, and found myself slipping on a patch of mud. (Cobbles were laid inside the village, but out here the road was in its usual poor condition, aggravated by the rains.) I fought desperately to keep my footing, but would not, until it was too late, bring out my other hand to help balance myself. As a result, I went slithering and sprawling and finally fell. Before I could recover, Henry was kneeling across me, holding the back of my head with his hand and pushing my face down into the mud. </p><p> This activity would normally have kept him happy for some time, but he found something of greater interest. I had instinctively used both hands to protect myself as I fell, and he saw the Watch on my wrist. In a moment he had wrenched it off, and stood up to examine it. I scrambled to my feet, and made a grab, but he held it easily above his head and out of my reach. </p><p> I said, panting, "Give that back!" </p><p> "It's not yours," he said. "It's your father's." </p><p> I was in agony in case the Watch had been damaged, broken maybe, in my fall, but even so I attempted to get my leg between his, to drop him. He parried, and, stepping back, said, </p><p> "Keep your distance." He braced himself, as though preparing to throw a stone. "Or I'll see how far I can fling it." </p><p> "If you do," I said, "you'll get a whipping for it." </p><p> There was a grin on his fleshy face. "So will you. And your father lays on heavier than mine does. I'll tell you what: I'll borrow it for a while. Maybe I'll let you have it back this afternoon. Or tomorrow." </p><p> "Someone will see you with it." </p><p> He grinned again. "I'll risk that." </p><p> I made a grab at him, I had decided that he was bluffing about throwing it away. I almost got him off balance, but not quite. We swayed and struggled, and then crashed together and rolled down into the ditch by the side of the road. There was some water in it, but we went on fighting, even after a voice challenged us from above. Jack -- for it was he who had called to us to get up -- had to come down and pull us apart by force. This was not difficult for him. He was as big as Henry, and tremendously strong also. He dragged us back up to the road, got to the root of the matter, took the Watch off Henry, and dismissed him with a clip across the back of the neck. </p><p> I said tearfully, "Is it all right?" </p><p> "I think so." He examined it, and handed it to me. "But you were a fool to bring it out." </p><p> "I wanted to show it to you." </p><p> "Not worth it," he said briefly. "Anyway, we'd better see about getting it back. I'll lend a hand." </p><p> Jack had always been around to a lend a hand, as long as I could remember. It was strange, I thought, as we walked toward the village, that in just over a week's time I would be on my own. The Capping would have taken place, and Jack would be a boy no longer. </p><p> Jack stood guard while I put the Watch back and returned the drawer key to the place where I had found it. I changed my wet and dirty trousers and shirt, and we retraced our steps to the ruins. No one knew what these buildings had once been, and I think one of the things that attracted us was a sign, printed on a chipped and rusted metal plate: </p><p><br> DANGER<br> 6,600 VOLTS </p><p><br> We had no idea what Volts had been, but the notion of danger, however far away and long ago, was exciting. There was more lettering, but for the most part the rust had destroyed it. lect city: we wondered if that were the city it had come from. </p><p> Farther along was the den Jack had made. One approached it through a crumbling arch; inside it was dry, and there was a place to build a fire. Jack had made one before coming out to look for me, and had skinned, cleaned, and skewered a rabbit ready for us to grill. There would be food in plenty at home -- the midday meal on a Saturday was always lavish -- but this did not prevent my looking forward greedily to roast rabbit with potatoes baked in the embers of the fire. Nor would it stop me doing justice to the steak pie my mother had in the oven. Although on the small side, I had a good appetite. </p><p> We watched and smelled the rabbit cooking in companionable silence. We could get on very well together without much conversation, though normally I had a ready tongue. Too ready, perhaps -- I knew that a lot of the trouble with Henry arose because I could not avoid trying to get a rise out of him whenever possible. </p><p> Jack was not much of a talker under any circumstances, but to my surprise, after a time he broke the silence. His talk was inconsequential at first, chatter about events that had taken place in the village, but I had the feeling that he was trying to get around to something else, something more important. Then he stopped, stared in silence for a second or two at the crisping carcass, and said, </p><p> "This place will be yours, after the Capping." </p><p> It was difficult to know what to say. I suppose if I had thought about it at all, I would have expected that he would pass the den on to me, but I had not thought about it. One did not think much about things connected with the Cappings, and certainly did not talk about them. For Jack, of all people, to do so was surprising, but what he said next was more surprising still. </p><p> "In a way," he said, "I almost hope it doesn't work. I'm not sure I wouldn't rather be a Vagrant." </p><p> I should say something about the Vagrants. Every village generally had a few -- at that time there were four in ours, as far as I knew -- but the number was constantly changing as some moved off and others took their place. They occasionally did a little work, but whether they did or not the village supported them. They lived in the Vagrant House, which in our case stood on the corner where the two roads crossed and was larger than all but a handful of houses (my father's being one). It could easily have accommodated a dozen Vagrants, and there had been times when there had been almost that many there. Food was supplied to them -- it was not luxurious, but adequate -- and a servant looked after the place. Other servants were sent to lend a hand when the House filled up. </p><p> What was known, though not discussed, was that the Vagrants were people for whom the Capping had proved a failure. They had Caps, as normal people did, but they were not working properly. If this were going to happen, it usually showed itself in the first day or two following a Capping: the person who had been Capped showed distress, which increased as the days went by, turning at last into a fever of the brain. In this state, they were clearly in much pain. Fortunately the crisis did not last long; fortunately also, it happened only rarely. The great majority of Cappings were entirely successful. I suppose only about one in twenty produced a Vagrant. </p><p> When he was well again, the Vagrant would start his wanderings. He, or she; because it happened occasionally with girls, although much more rarely. Whether it was because they saw themselves as being outside the community of normal people, or because the fever had left a permanent restlessness in them, I did not know. But off they would go and wander through the land, stopping a day here, as long as a month there, but always moving on. Their minds, certainly, had been affected. None of them could settle to a train of thought for long, and many had visions, and did strange things. </p><p> They were taken for granted, and looked after, but, like the Cappings, not much talked about. Children, generally, viewed them with suspicion and avoided them. They, for their part, mostly seemed melancholy, and did not talk much, even to each other. It was a great shock to hear Jack say he half wished to be a Vagrant, and I did not know how to answer him. But he did not seem to need a response. He said, "The Watch -- do you ever think what it must have been like in the days when things like that were made?" </p><p> I had, from time to time, but it was another subject on which speculation was not encouraged, and Jack had never talked in this way before. I said, "Before the Tripods?" </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "Well, we know it was the Black Age. There were too many people, and not enough food, so that people starved, and fought each other, and there were all kinds of sicknesses, and..." </p><p> "And things like the Watch were made -- by men, not the Tripods." </p><p> "We don't know that." </p><p> "Do you remember," he asked, "four years ago, when I went to stay with my Aunt Matilda?" </p><p> I remembered. She was his aunt, not mine, even though we were cousins: she had married a foreigner. Jack said, "She lives at Bishopstoke, on the other side of Winchester. I went out one day, walking, and I came to the sea. There were the ruins of a city that must have been twenty times as big as Win...</p></p><h2>The Good, the Bad, and the Undead</h2><p><p>It's a tough life for witch Rachel Morgan, sexy, independent bounty hunter, prowlng the darkest shadows of downtown Cincinnati for criminal creatures of the night.</p><p>She can handle the leather-clad vamps and even tangle with a cunning demon or two.

God Jr. is a stunningly accomplished new novel that marks a new phase in Cooper's noteworthy career.<br>God Jr. is the story of Jim, a father who survived the car crash that killed his teenage son Tommy. Tommy was distant, transfixed by video games and pop culture, and a mystery to the man who raised him. Now, disabled by the accident, yearning somehow to absolve his own guilt over the crash, Jim becomes obsessed with a mysterious building Tommy drew repetitively in a notebook before he died. As the fixation grows, Jim starts to take on elements of his son-at the expense of his job and marriage-but is he connecting with who Tommy truly was?<br>A tender, wrenching look at guilt, grief, and the tenuous bonds of family, God Jr. is unlike anything Dennis Cooper has yet written.

Cooper (<i>Closer</i>, etc.) does just that&#x2014;and it works, for a while. Pot-smoking, 40-something L.A. depressive Jim rammed his Lexus into a telephone pole, sending his son, Tommy, flying through the windshield and leaving himself crippled. He has subsequently lied about the cause of Tommy's death (Tommy lived long enough to wander from the scene) and begun working at a children's custom clothing company run by an all-handicapped crew. Upping his pot intake and drifting further from his wife, Bette, Jim has been obsessively constructing a monument to Tommy in his yard that has drawn media (and litigious) attention. Cooper's genius has always been for dialogue: the clipped marriage and workplace exchanges feature searing ironies and delicate nuances that are arresting. In the lyrical but muddled passages that dominate the book's second half, Jim loses himself in a video game of Tommy's, communicating mystically with the video game's flora and fauna while searching for a meaning to Tommy's life and death. Cooper leaves Jim and Bette stranded in their grief, and the various forms of sage-like solace he proffers fail to add up to much, either for Jim or for us. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Just consult this lavishly illustrated compendium of all things hashish. Appealing to illicit substance consumers and history buffs alike, Clarke traces the hashish story from earliest times to the present and describes traditional methods of collecting cannabis resin and processing the gooey stuff into hashish. He also debunks persistent tidbits of cannabis lore: for instance, somewhere, it is said, in some culture, naked maidens scamper through hemp fields, and the resin they gather thereby is scraped from their bodies; enticing as that notion may be, no hard data verify it. Nor is there any efficacy in reaming a hash pipe and smoking the dross; the psychoactive THC in the hash burned the first time, and the only effects of toking the scrapings are those of hyperventilation. Nowhere does Clarke advocate breaking the law in pursuit of his subject, so for most libraries this is ostensibly history. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>Plant Progagation</h2><p>Produced in association with the Royal Horticultural Society, the titles in this series have become standard works of practical gardening reference.

With Flower Pounding, the possibilities are endless!</p><p>With a bit of simple preparation, an ordinary piece of muslin becomes a canvas for the intriguing art of flower pounding. Taped to the muslin and whacked with a hammer, nearly any type of flower or leaf surrenders its pigment, leaving behind a ghostly image resembling watercolor painting. By outlining these delicate images with permanent marker and stitching over them, Ann Frischkorn and Amy Sandrin turn them into lovely quilts. Some specifically resemble the flowers from which they came: roses, alstroemeria, irises, morning glories, and many other blossoms arranged in a central panel, ringed by a quilted--and sometimes pieced--border. In others the flowers have been pounded through stencils, to lend their translucent hues to shapes of fish, coffee cups, even a skateboarder designed and pounded by Sandrin's son (yes, kids will love this noisy, rewarding activity).<p> Once they've explained fabric preparation and the specifics of the technique itself, the authors present a gallery of 40 of their quilts, accompanied by commentary about what inspired each design and some of the flowers appearing in it. The project section offers another seven designs, with brief directions about creating them. The actual quilting and piecing instructions are quite cursory; though the designs are relatively basic, at least a nodding acquaintance with quilting methods is presumed. As for the actual pounding, the authors recommend experimenting with various types of flowers, remarking that the color of the bloom is not necessarily the color after pounding and that even flowers from the same plant picked on different days may result in different shades. But a bit more information about what general color ranges they tend to expect would have been helpful. The "flower index" at book's end--composed of 57 color photos representing a selection of flowers used throughout the quilts--seems like an ideal place to have indicated something about this. Still, this is an interesting and different approach to fabric adornment and might be nice on wearables too, although the authors don't mention whether the flower-pounded fabric will stand up to washing. Further experimentation ought to resolve this issue as well. <i>--Amy Handy</i></p>Ann Frischkorn and Amy Sandrin are identical twins.

These objects, left behind on Earth and in space, can be massive (dead satellites in eternal orbit) or tiny (discarded zip ties around a defunct space antenna). They can be bold (an American flag on the moon) or hopeful (messages from Earth sent into deep space). They raise interesting questions: Why did Elon Musk feel compelled to send a red Tesla into space? What accounts for the multiple rocket-themed playgrounds constructed after the Russians launched Sputnik? Gorman&#x2015;affectionately known as &#x201c;Dr Space Junk&#x201d; &#x2015;takes readers on a journey through the solar system and beyond, deploying space artifacts, historical explorations, and even the occasional cocktail recipe in search of the ways that we make space meaningful.</p><p>Engaging and erudite, Gorman recounts her background as a (nonspace) archaeologist and how she became interested in space artifacts. She shows us her own piece of space junk: a fragment of the fuel tank insulation from Skylab, the NASA spacecraft that crash-landed in Western Australia in 1979. She explains that the conventional view of the space race as &#x201c;the triumph of the white, male American astronaut&#x201d; seems inadequate; what really interests her, she says, is how everyday people engage with space. To an archaeologist, objects from the past are significant because they remind us of what we might want to hold on to in the future.</p></p><p>Alice Gorman is a leader in the emerging field of space archaeology.

Paul McCartney</p><p>The With The Beatles album cover was taken soon after I met them for the first time inBournemouth. Since the photograph was needed urgently, I had to improvise a studiosituation in the hotel. The dining room was the most suitable location. There was a broadsidelight from the windows and a deep maroon curtain that could be pulled behind themto create a dark background. They came down at midday wearing their black polo-neckedsweaters. It seemed natural to photograph them in black-and-white wearing their customarydark clothes. It gave unity to the image. There was no makeup, hairdresser or stylist--justmyself, The Beatles and a camera--a Pentax SLR with a 180mm telephoto lens. The lensaperture was set at F22 to ensure depth of focus between Ringo in the foreground and Paul at the back. The telephoto lensalso compressed them into a tight group shot with all the heads more or less the same size. They had to fit into the squareformat of the cover, so rather than have them all in a line, I put Ringo in the bottom right corner. He was the last to jointhe group, he was the shortest and he was the drummer! Even so, he still had to bend his knees to get to the right level--and look natural! <p>Some people have thought the image was a montage, but it was a single shot. The printing of the sleeve turned out much darker than expected. A lot of the textured quality in the reproduction print was lost. In fact the English version looked like four white faces in a coal cellar. Fortunately, the American version, with the title changed to Meet The Beatles, was the same black-and-white photograph with a blue tone, showing more detail in the shadow area. </p><p>This cover shot was an extension of my black-and-white jazz photography and the idea for the composition came from a photograph taken earlier the same year of three graphic designers (see previous page). The picture had a mood and directness that was the antithesis of the way groups usually appeared on album covers at that time. George Martin deserves credit for supporting this approach since colour was the norm for pop albums. Although George ran the subsidiary Parlophone label, the cover had to be approved by the management at EMI. </p><p>My original idea was to feature the picture of The Beatles across the whole album without logos or titles. By then, The Beatles were famous and their faces well known. This would have been a truly original breakthrough. But the proposal was too radical for EMI, and at the time neither Brian nor The Beatles had authority over those decisions.

He was the author of more than thirty detective novels and was greatly admired by his peers, including Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler.Wills Crofts is one of the masters of the golden age of British detective fiction. Not only is this a first-rate puzzler, but Crofts' outrage over the financial firm's betrayal of the public trust should resonate with today's readers. (Connie Fletcher <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Good story, very likeable characters,and a unexpected twist at the end. The pace is perhaps somewhat slower but it doesn't interfere with the pleasure of reading. Just perfect for a rainy weekend. (Karina Dumiati <i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed Mystery In The Channel, my first but not last taste of Mr Crofts' work, as it is a good old fashioned puzzle which had me baffled so I have no hesitation in recommending it as a very good read. (Elaine Tomasso <i>Goodreads</i>)<br><br>A standout in the British Crime Classics series. Nary a woman to be seen onstage, though if you're interested in ships and sailing this book will suit your fancy. A greatly enjoyable police procedural from 1931. (Lauren LaTulip <i>Goodreads</i>)<br><br>It was an interesting case and I liked the main character, so it was an enjoyable read. (Deborah White <i>Goodreads</i>)<br><br>I really enjoyed this deviously difficult detective story. It was full of twists and turns, action and danger, and a hell of a lot of mystery. Admittedly, I had my suspicions as to the murderer, but even still I was kept guessing until near the end. It was more full of red herrings than a fisherman's net! (Matthew Barnes <i>Carpe Libris</i>)<br><br>First published in 1931 Mystery in the Channel by Freeman Wills Crofts is a classic crime fiction novel written during the Golden Age of detective fiction between the two world wars.~~~ I thought the comments on the effect of the company's crash on ordinary people is still as relevant today as it was in the 1930s and the Assistant Police Commissioner's views on crime and punishment showing a surprising sympathy with the criminal are interesting. He deplored the punishment of the out-of-work or poorly paid thief who had stolen to provide for his family&#x2019;s&#x2019; needs. And he had 'the most profound enmity and contempt' for the wealthy thief who stole through the manipulation of stocks and shares or by other financial methods, whether those means were within or without the limits of the law. (Margaret Freeman <i>Books Please</i>)<br><br>This particular novel is a fine example of meticulous police work before the advent of computers, DNA analysis, and instant communications. The novel, published in 1931, is in period, but definitely not dated.

He is a travelling companion of the best sort - erudite, witty and eccentric. Crossing mountain, desert, ocean and three millennia of history, he portrays hyrax hunters and dhow skippers, a noseless regicide, and a sword-wielding tyrant with a passion for Heinz Russian salad. Yet even the ordinary Yemenis are extraordinary: their family tree goes back to Noah and is rooted in a land which, in the words of a contemporary poet, has become the dictionary of its people.<br>Accompanied by etchings drawn from the life by Martin Yeoman, Yemen: Travels in Dictionary Land is an Arabian Grand Tour, a book in which every page is dashed - like the land it describes - with the marvellous.</p><p>Tim Mackintosh-Smith studied Classical Arabic at Oxford. At the age of 21, he headed east for the real Arabia. For the past 17 years, he has lived in the Yemeni capital, San&#39;a - a place which has missed out on many of the more awful aspects of the post medieval period. His first book, Yemen: Travels in Dictionary Land, won the 1998 Thomas Cook/Daily Telegraph Travel Book Award and his next book Travels with a Tangerine was critically acclaimed.Utilizing his experience of living in Yemen since 1982, Mackintosh-Smith takes readers with him through mountains, deserts, and coastal and inland cities as he travels this unique land. He walks down wadis, rides in cabs and trucks and takes a dhow out to an isolated island. Observations of daily life, such as his section on the subculture of the chewing of qat or kat, the mildly narcotic leaf used by Yemeni men, give a sense of the rich history of this nation, once a humming crossroads for the early trade in myrrh and frankincense. A plethora of unfamiliar names and places can make the history difficult to follow, but patient readers will be rewarded with a witty and humorous travel story.

Kirk orders the <i>Enterprise</i> to put in for repairs at the new space station: Starbase 47, also known as Vanguard. </p><p> As Kirk ponders the mystery of the enormous base, he begins to suspect that there is much more to Vanguard than meets the eye.

With a casual sweep of his hand, Cervantes Quinn pulled a long twist of his tangled, bone-white hair from his eyes and tucked it behind his ear. An insidious humidity amplified the post-sundown radiant heat and left Quinn's sweat-sodden clothing clinging like a skin graft with pockets to his thick-middled, past-its-prime body. </p><p> He straightened from his crouch and reached into his left pants pocket. Nestled deep inside, under the lock-picking kit, past his last snack stick of meat-flavored synthetic something-or-other, was his flask. As quietly as he was able, he pulled it free, unscrewed the cap, and downed a swig of nameless green liquor. It tasted horrible. He kept it in his flask only because his most frequent employer, an Orion merchant-prince named Ganz, had an irregular habit of demanding that other people pour him impromptu drinks -- and then shooting anyone who poured something he didn't like. Ganz liked the green stuff. </p><p> Awful as it was, it still constituted a minor improvement over the stale aftertaste of the pseudo-beef snack stick Quinn had devoured an hour ago. He took another swig, then tucked the half-empty flask back into the bottom of his pocket. This stakeout was taking longer than he had expected. He had imagined himself long gone by now, the pilfered device securely hidden behind the false wall panel in the cargo bay of his private freighter, the <i>Rocinante.</i> Instead, he swatted blindly at the high-pitched mosquitoes that he could hear dive-bombing his head but couldn't see unless they passed between him and the lights of the camp below. </p><p> From his vantage point deep in the undergrowth, beyond the tree line that marked the perimeter of the mining camp, he saw the prospectors moving from one semipermanent building to another. Most were winding down for the night, settling into their bunks, making final trips to the latrine. Vexing him were the two who continued to sit inside their Spartan mess hall, playing the most uninspired game of cards Quinn had ever seen. </p><p> He was certain he could beat them handily in just about any game, from Texas Hold'em to Denobulan Wildcard. For a moment, he allowed himself to consider scrapping his mission of covert confiscation in favor of card-sharking the mining team. Quinn's common sense awoke from its slumber and reminded him not only that it would be wrong to cheat honest working folks but that, if he returned to Vanguard without the sensor screen he'd been sent to steal, Ganz would garnish his next buffet with Quinn's viscera. </p><p> Patience was not one of Quinn's stronger virtues, but his impulses were usually kept in check by his healthy fear of death, injury, and incarceration. Long after he had become convinced that his knees had fused into position and would never allow him to straighten again, the last two miners restacked their cards, snapped an elastic band around them, and left them on the table as they got up. They turned out the mess-hall lamp and stepped out the door into the murky spills of weak orange light from lamps strung on drooping wires between their shacks. Despite the multilayered soundscape of the jungle that surrounded Quinn, he heard their every squishing step as they trudged across the muddy dirt road and passed out of sight on the far side of the barracks. Their shadows, long and blurred, fell across another building. Deep, repetitive clomping sounds echoed around the camp as the miners kicked the wet filth from their boots. Finally they entered their barracks, and the door slam-rattled shut behind them. </p><p> Batting away lush fronds and dangling loops of thorny vines, Quinn skulked forward toward the camp. An arthritic aching in his knees threatened to slow him down, but he ignored it, lured forward by the promise of an easy night's work. He paused at the edge of the tree line. There was no sign of automated security devices -- no cameras, motion detectors, or sentry guns. Not that he had expected any, necessarily, but the presence of the sensor screen in a mining camp had aroused his suspicion. It wasn't the kind of equipment normally found in civilian hands. Ganz hadn't said how he had come to learn of its presence here on Ravanar IV, and Quinn wasn't foolish enough to ask. </p><p> He unholstered his stun pistol. The street was empty. In the distance, something shrieked three times in quick succession and something else roared in reply. With his hand resting lightly on the grip of his sidearm, he emerged from the trees and moved in a quick, low jog across the street. The mud under his boots made every step an adventure; it slipped like congealed hydraulic lubricant and stank like the open sewers of Korinar. Several quick steps brought him back into the cover of shadow. He leaned sideways and cast a furtive glance around the corner into the dark, narrow stretch between the barracks and the equipment shed. It was empty, and he stole into it, his feet seeking out the driest -- and therefore quietest -- patches of ground from stride to stride. </p><p> The sensor screen was larger than he had expected. Ganz's drawing of the device had not been to scale, and it had led Quinn to believe that its removal would be as simple as unplugging it and tucking it under one arm. On the contrary, the cylindrical machine was almost as big as Quinn himself, and, if his approximation of its duranium content was on the money, it was at least twice as heavy. He considered stealing one of the miners' cargo pallets, but then he remembered how much noise the lifter would make. <i>Damn thing'll wake the entire camp, he groused silently. This would've been easier if my ship had a transporter.</i> He had often toyed with the notion of installing one, but his ship's limited power-generation capability meant that to operate a transporter would require sacrificing another system of equal energy level. Unfortunately, the only one that came close was the inertial dampener, and since it was the one thing that prevented routine starflight from turning him into chunky salsa, he was loath to part with it. </p><p> An idea occurred to him: <i>I could just steal the active component and leave the power module. Just take the part that's hard to get.</i> Examining the device more closely, he realized that the top segment constituted the screen generator, and that once it was separated from the much larger and heavier power supply he would be able to carry it out on his own. He dug into the lower pockets along his pants leg, found the tools he needed, and set to work. Another quick scan registered no sign of power inside the device; it appeared to be inert. That was for the best, in Quinn's opinion. A few simple twists and toggles later, he decoupled its primary power-supply cable. </p><p> No sooner had the cable come free than a scramble of data flooded his scanner. Eyeing the readings, he made the belated discovery that the sensor screen had, in fact, been active the entire time he had been here -- and, true to its intended function, it had fooled his scanner. </p><p> His ears detected the muffled din of an alarm klaxon. Doors banged open against sheet-metal shelter walls. Running footfalls slapped through the mud, converging on his location. Using a sonic screwdriver he'd swiped from a rather daft chap back on Barolia, he torqued off the sensor screen's restraining bolts, wrapped his arms around the screen generator, and hefted it with an agonized grunt. He stumbled backward, tripped over something that he couldn't see in the dark, and dropped the device. </p><p> With the unmistakable crack of something breaking, the device struck whatever unseen piece of junk had found its way under Quinn's feet. A sizable chunk of it struck his foot hard enough to launch a string of vulgarities from his mouth. Hopping on his good foot proved an unwise reaction, as he immediately slipped and wound up on his back, in the mud, and looking at a cluster of angry miners at the end of the alley. </p><p> "Hey, fellas," he said, flailing in the muck to get himself upright. "I know this looks pretty bad, but -- " One of the men drew what Quinn was certain was a Starfleet phaser pistol. Assessing the situation calmly, Quinn ran like hell. </p><p> With his arms and legs windmilling as he struggled for traction on the greasy mud, his movement was so clumsy and erratic that the first phaser shot -- whose tonal pitch Quinn recognized as level-five heavy stun -- narrowly missed him and scorched the wall behind his head. Finding his footing, he sprinted out of the alley on a mad dash for the tree line. As he crossed the street, he heard the group of armed men running up the alley to follow him. </p><p> Two more simultaneous phaser shots quickened Quinn's already frantic pace. One sizzled the mud behind his heel; the other passed over his shoulder and crisped its way through the foliage. He plunged straight into the stygian forest, zigzagging through the densely packed trees and ducking through nooses of vine. Blue phaser fire shimmered in the gloom, slicing wildly around his chaotic path. </p><p> <i>Where's the damn trail?</i> Seconds seemed stretched by the adrenaline coursing through Quinn's brain. He felt like he'd been running twice as long as necessary to find the path back to his ship. Then he broke free of the jungle's clinging tendrils and stumbled out onto the narrow, dry creek bed he had followed down this side of the hill from his ship. At the time, landing on the other side of the hilltop had seemed clever. Banked in steep, thick cloud cover even at this low elevation, it had enabled him to glide in unseen and unheard. </p><p> Now, unfortunately, it meant running for his life uphill. </p><p> His pursuers were getting closer. <i>Time for tricks,</i> he concluded. Several meters ahead, a sizable boulder offered him some cover. He reached the rock and dove to the ground behind it just before another volley of neon-blue phaser beams lashed across its pitted face. Fumbling through assorted bits of junk in his pockets, he found the detonator. The angry whine of another phaser blast bit off nearly a quarter of one side of the bould...</p></p>
